# Senior Dev Growth Plan

## Opportunities

### Scope

Create more reusable components that can and will be used by others on the team

Abstract more of the components that I have created so they can be used by others

Unsure of what greater ownership on team projects would look like, as I am the only React dev on our team, and coordination of projects rests on Josie and Nick

### Role Complexity

Create guides on how to approach complex topics like creating useful custom hooks

### Technical Skill Level

Creating more documentation would make more permanent conduits for transfer of knowledge

Scheduling lunch and learns with the React team?
	> I don't wanna make useless meetings
	
Could dig in more into specific specialities in development, like accessibility

### Influence

### Leadership and Autonomy

## Successes

### Scope

Layout components are fairly complex, and require a high degree of flexibility to work in the many situations that they will be needed in

Started our move towards using more app-wide React Contexts, to be able to use data in the same way throughout our application

### Role Complexity

Messages had many technically complex aspects

### Technical Skill Level

I pass off my knowledge over Zoom and Slack regularly

I try to always have a constructive piece of feedback to give to my fellow developers on PRs

Added in testing and Storybook into our codebase

Brought JSDocs into our codebase to document our code

Spurred on the use of Context throughout our application for application wide state, and taught some team members more about how it works
