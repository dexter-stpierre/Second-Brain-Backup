# Blog

I discussed the idea of a product and development blog with [[Josie Wittwer]] in our [[1:1]] today. She said that she liked the idea and would have to discuss the idea with management to make sure that they are okay with it. She also asked me to send her a list of other companies that do this. I will also write up a formal plan of how we will approach this so she has something more concrete to share with management.

## Other Companies Blogs

- [Leadpages](https://www.leadpages.com/blog/category/design/) (has design section)
- [Logrocket](https://blog.logrocket.com/next-level-component-showcasing-with-storybook-controls/)
- [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/)
- [Doist](https://doist.dev/) (Mostly productivity, but also has product focused posts)
- [Discord](https://blog.discord.com/)
- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/blog/)
- [Airbnb](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering)
- [Spotify](https://engineering.atspotify.com/)
- [Square](https://developer.squareup.com/blog/)
- [Headspace](https://medium.com/headspace-engineering)
- [Dropbox](https://dropbox.tech/)

## Plan

- All blog posts would require approval from some member of senior leadership prior to publishing to ensure that there are no trade secrets in the posts (Shane, Larry, Brian, Jon, Josie, whoever they determine would be the appropriate approver)
- We would have a person or team in charge of editing and giving marketing sign off (ensure proper spelling + punctuation, ensure we are using correct terms, etc.)
- Anyone on the product and engineering teams can write posts about anything in the product and engineering world that they want
- A post brief would first be written. This would comprise of a couple paragraph write up of the topic to be written on, the problem that the writer encountered, and the solution that they came to. This will ensure that we have a record of what the writer intended to write about and we have a short piece to evaluate to determine post priority.
- The writer can proceed to write the actual post while waiting for the post to be prioritized. If they begin right away they will have to find the time to do so around the rest of their work. Writing a post is not a reason to get behind on work at this point It's always best to at least get a first draft down while you are still in the headspace that you came up with the idea
- When a brief has been chosen the writer will receive a .5 point writing task, and a 1 point editing task to ensure that writing the post is prioritized among their other work and not an extra strain on the developer.
- If other resources were used in discovering the solution they should be linked to either in the post, or at the end. These sources helped us to build our product, the least we can do is give credit where it's due.
