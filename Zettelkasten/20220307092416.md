I don't understand why people choose to read books that are so clearly partisan. Like they think they are going to get a truthful accounting of events from people like Bill Barr, Donald Trump, or Hillary Clinton. Everything that they write will be to make themselves and those in their circle look good. They are never going to give a realistic accounting of events.

I wonder if biographies written by other people are more trust worthy than autobiographies for that same reason. At the minimum I think reading only an autobiography and taking that as truth is flawed. But of course you _always_ have to consider a biographers biases when reading their works
