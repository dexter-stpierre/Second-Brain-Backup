I don't want to be in a spot where I am more interested in what I can do with a tool than how a tool can help me get stuff done. My productivity system will now be Notes as my main Inbox (also email, because I can't do much about that) and Jira will also function as an inbox for me. I will bring everything assigned to me in the ready column into [[Todoist]]. This will allow me to write up comments that will help me to plan out how I will approach the ticket and how it relates to others. My inboxes will be processed into either [[Obsidian]], [[Todoist]], or [[Instapaper]] depending on if it should be stored as a reference or part of a working document, a task, or a piece of reading. ^c4fd9c

I should always keep a way to differentiate between other's thoughts and mine. The Readwise filter is one good way to do that. Maybe keeping literature notes in a different folder will be helpful too

I wonder if deciding to import books from [[Readwise]] piecemeal would be better so that there isn't so much outside content in there

I wonder how I'll start to piece apart this note as I come into a more formal idea of what my system will be. Maybe I should use my daily notes to dump these kinds of things. But I really want to make sure it doesn't get lost

Obsidians separation of imported notes, and daily notes, in their own folder makes me feel the need to write since it's more obvious what is my own notes and what it's someone else's
    Another thing that prevents Obsidian from feeling artificially full is that they don't make a new page every time you create an internal link. So there aren't hundreds of pages that have no actual content. If there is a note it is because you created it and most likely started writing in it

One nice thing about Obsidian just using md files is that if I want to do some batch renaming, or relocating of files I can do so programmatically using Javascript/node

    There doesn't seem to be a friendly way like SmartBlocks to handle this for Obsidian. I can look into a new tool to handle it, or just do it manually like I did before SmartBlocks
        I wonder if I could just use an Alfred workflow.. Seems like it would be easy. Just highlight the start time and then run the workflow. 
        I think the right option is to just do this manually. I can use the [[Daily Log]] page as a header for this content. It will help me to be able to close it up. This will take place on my daily page. I will start by putting the starting timestamp. Then I will make a short list of what I plan to work on. Once I finish working I will mark the end time, put the total time, and put the hours in which the work took place as a page in the format of H:00. This will help me determine what times I am most productive. I will also write out a brief of what I completed, and what I plan for the next work block
        Could this actually be a good place to use pen/paper?
            This might cause enough friction that I might not actually do it
        [[Pomodoro]] technique might be helpful for making sure that I am working in small enough chunks to actually journal about
            [[Pomodone]] seems like a useful tool that could be used to track Pomos and it integrates with Todoist and it has an export option that I could possibly import into [[Obsidian]] https://todoist.com/integrations/apps/pomodone

Todoist Inbox is much easier to process and more in your face. I just wish I could save a task without making it as done but remove it from the Inbox. 
    Maybe I'll just move forward with the tile that done + Inbox means it was processed and moved elsewhere 
    
I should probably figgure out some ground rules of how I will use Todoist to keep it from getting out of hand. The last thing I want is to pay for an app with an endless nuber of tasks that I will never complete
    Maybe dats that are > 90 days old I need to either schedule, delete, or add to a someday/maybe project
        This project could be sorted by VERY general areas
    Maybe I should give this time to evolve into something unruly BEFORE trying to limit it. Better to figure out how I use it first

Ideas for blog posts should be stored in [[Todoist]]?
    This keeps from the appearance of being productive on blog posts without actually working on them
    I do however want to be able to collect the notes that would be used for the idea. Maybe the can be stored in a list in a note, and things can be linked to the line in the note. And then there could be a list of them in a project on [[Todoist]]. When I start to actually work on an idea I can either move it into a project or create subtasks for the task
        Doing a project would be nice because I could create a template for myself which would make creating all of the tasks easy

The best apps are the ones that try to minimize your time using them. The less time you need to spend on an app to accomplish your goal you opened it for the more time you have to actually pursue your goals

Any changes to my system should be short and sweet. This should be a thing that helps me do work, it shouldn't just be another thing to work on

On Readwise I will use the `#Formative Writings` tag to keep track of the writings that have had major influences on the way I think and work

# My approach to rewrites
- Ensure you review any previous code
- Ensure you review any previous tests

Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, and Yearly notes should have sections for planning and reviewing
