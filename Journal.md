## Import From [[Roam]]

### [[September 7th, 2021, Tuesday]]

 today was an okay day. [[Taylor]] worked at 4:45 so we woke up at 3:55. there is just no way to function at 100% when you get up that early. so I wasn’t super productive at work or besides that either. I am looking forward to getting to sleep tonight though. I spent some time today just powering through some shorter articles in Instapaper, so I guess that was pretty good

### [[September 6th, 2021, Monday]]

today was a productive day. we got stuff that was stored at [[Rosendo St Pierre]]’s house, did groceries, and I cleaned the basement all in all a good day

### [[September 5th, 2021, Sunday]]

today was a good day. we woke up a little late, went for a [[Walk]] around [[Lake Como]], then chilled at home for a minute. then I went to see Shang Chi with [[Jack Carlson]]. it was really good. after that [[Taylor]] went to get coffee with [[Natasha Anderson]] because they were having a hard time. also, [[Terry Giller]] went to the ER today because she has been sick lately. she is being sent home today though. and [[Taylor]] made us a snack board that we had for dinner while watching the new Cinderella movie

### [[September 1st, 2021, Wednesday]]

we took [[Isabella Richards]] to [[Dave & Buster’s]] tonight. she had a ton of fun. I was happy to see her enjoy herself so much. I also read quite a few articles from [[UFYH]] today. they were really encouraging. I wanna do a better job of keeping our habitat in a state that brings us peace and joy.

### [[August 27th, 2021, Friday]]

today was a pretty typical day. was pretty productive at work, went to the gym, made dinner, then watched some shows. all in all pretty good. last night I slept terribly. Betty kept on moving around a basically body slamming into me

### [[August 17th, 2021, Tuesday]]

today we went to [[Rosendo St Pierre]]’s house to help with yard work. none of us felt like doing it but it ended up not being that big of a deal. it actually went by really fast

### [[August 13th, 2021, Friday]]

today was a good day. we are watching the [[Ewing]] kids today and tomorrow.  [[Charlie Ewing]] had a bunch of friends over and we all hung out with them, it was a good time. I was also really productive at work today, which felt nice

### [[August 12th, 2021, Thursday]]

I got nearly all of the things I wanted to finish for work today done. I just have a couple of things to make sure got deployed, and one more error on the name folder modal. we ended up cancelling dinner because our meeting with [[Ginger Ewing]] set off [[Taylor]]’s eating disorder tendencies.

### [[August 11th, 2021, Wednesday]]

Today was an interesting day. I wasn't very productive at work. Honestly the best parts of my day were getting to rock climb, and reading at the end of the day.

### [[June 23rd, 2021, Wednesday]]

today I wasn’t very productive at work. I really need to be more productive the next few days if I’m gonna finish everything I need to before my PTO. after finishing this I will lay out the most important things I need to finish tomorrow to ensure that I finish that must be done. today [[Taylor]] was having a hard body day so she wanted to change up the plan for dinner so that it was lighter. I made chicken with a sauce that was chicken broth, red wine vinegar, coconut cream, salt, pepper, onion, and a little bit of flour to thicken it. it turned out really good

### [[June 15th, 2021, Tuesday]]

today we went to [[Topgolf]] to celebrate [[Jesse Richards]]’ birthday. it was fun. there were a couple of other guys there, Mitch and Jonathan. they were fairly fun to be around. not necessarily my find of guys, but still fun. tonight [[Taylor]] and I played some [[Sequence]], read for a little bit, and watched 2 episodes of [law and order]([[TV]])

### [[June 11th, 2021, Friday]]

Today was a big day. [[Taylor]] had an appointment with her Gynecologist because she went 6 months without having her period. Thankfully there were no possibly diagnosis that are deadly, but it could mean that she is infertile, or possibly pre diabetic. I accepted the responsibility to make healthier meal plans for lunch and dinner. we are also gonna get her a membership at Orange Theory. these possible diagnosis are fairly scary, but I know that we can get through them together and we will both be better for it

### [[June 10th, 2021, Thursday]]

tonight we watched Rosey and Mara’s girls so they could get a burger that supposedly induces labor. Mara’s due date was yesterday so we are really hoping that it works out! also tonight I finally heard from [[Thorn]] and they are still working to align the teams schedule so that they can move me forward to a third interview! I am so excited and can’t believe that I am actually getting the chance to move forward in the process! I am looking forward to hearing back and getting that interview in the calendar!

### [[June 9th, 2021, Wednesday]]

today I got together with some coworkers at [[Dangerous Man Brewery]]. it’s was the first time meeting most of them in person, so that was pretty cool

### [[June 7th, 2021, Monday]]

today was a pretty mixed bag day. I still haven’t heard from [[Thorn]] and I just want to know if i get the job or not. not hearing anything is super frustrating. today was [[Alexandre St-Pierre]]’s first day at [[OFW]] which is pretty excited. I hope he really enjoys this job. and [[Taylor]] and I had some really good laughs today. it felt really nice to laugh that hard. and I read part of a really interesting article from [[Mark Manson]]. I am excited to keep reading it and start to implement the things he talks about

### [[May 19th, 2021, Wednesday]]

What a big day today was. [[Alexandre St-Pierre]] called me when we were on our walk to share that he got the job at [[OFW]]! He got a great offer and this job could really change his life for the better in so many ways. Also [[Meghan Fletcher]] got into town today. She will be staying with us for a couple of days and [[Amy Fletcher]] and [[Lindsey Fletcher]] will be getting in super late tomorrow. It will be nice to get to spend a couple of days with all of them

### [[May 18th, 2021, Tuesday]]

Today is mine and [[Taylor]]'s [[Anniversary]]. We went for a walk, like we always do, then went to dinner at Teresas, watched [[The Voice]], and then got ice cream. It was a good day. I was pretty short with her earlier and I feel really bad about it

### [[May 17th, 2021, Monday]]

today I got an email requesting another interview at [[Thorn]]!! I have dreamed of working here for the last 4 years and I am so excited to move forward in the process! also, when I was talking with [[Alexandre St-Pierre]] on the phone he told me that he plans to move in with [[Mom]] and [[Dad]] to take advantage of a program that [[Tennessee]] has that offers free [[Community College]] to adults so he can become a chef! this has always been one of his biggest dreams and I am so proud of him for finding a way to pursue that!

### [[October 1st, 2020, Thursday]]

Today was a good day. I was very productive at [work]([[OFW]]), I finished like 5 tickets. I got some good [[Learn]]ing in. I [[FaceTime]]d with [[Sam Tupy]]. It was really nice talking and catching up with him. He's someone I could see myself becoming good [[Friends]] with. He told me that him and [[Alex Anderson]] play [[Xbox]] and have deep conversations. I wanna get in on that. Oh and [[Taylor]]'s book [[I Said It]] got approved today! She's officially an author! I don't know that this writing process has helped me to develop any [[Original Thought]]s. I hope that some time and work brings them soon.

### [[September 13th, 2020, Sunday]]

today was an interesting day. Taylor and I bickered a lot, which was frustrating. but it was still a good day. we walked around Raspberry Island, watched the Vikings game with the Jeska’s. after that we went to Dinner with Sophia and Harris and got Pho. they paid for our dinner which was super nice. after dinner Taylor and I played a game of Mario Party and I took Betty for a walk. Betty did a good job training, but the last lay down was pretty tough for her. I think I need to be more energetic when training her

### [[September 12th, 2020, Saturday]]

today was a good day. we took [[Betty]] to the [[Battle Creek Dog Park]], I did most of the work I have left for [[Phoenix]], we had rice bowls for dinner and we watched a movie. overall a good day

### [[September 11th, 2020, Friday]]

had a pretty typical day of work today. nothing too engaging. Chad helped me work through an issue changing branches, so that was nice. we went over to [[Arianne Richards]] and [[Jesse Richards]] house for dinner and ate potato soup with them. I found $20 on the ground in the park

### [[January 15th, 2020, Wednesday]]

This morning Taylor worked a little later than normal so I just left for her Caribou at the same time as her. This got me to Caribou a little later than I wanted to be. In order to do my [[Morning Routine]] the way that I want to I need to have about an hour to dedicate to it. So I think I would like to leave for Caribou around 6, 6:15 at the latest. Work today was alright. We had a 2 hour long meeting in the morning which I find typically drains me for the rest of the day. Maybe on days that we have a long morning meeting I should plan on bringing some gym stuff and going for a run at lunch. This might help energize me for the rest of the day. Taylor and I went to the gym and I ran almost a mile and a half at 6 mph. It felt really good to have a nice long run, even though my heart rate was through the roof the entire time. Then Taylor and I ate the leftovers from Porterhouse for dinner and sat in bed chatting. We did our budget. I need to get better at adding the budget to an app and actually tracking it. I should see if I can clear out YNAB and restart from the beginning. That should be an option. We budgeted to get new backpacks for China and ordered them tonight. Mine is going to arrive tomorrow. I am really excited to get it and see if it was really what I wanted.

### [[January 13th, 2020, Monday]]

Today Taylor and I had a semi productive day taking care of some stuff for China. This morning we went to the Secretary of State's department to get some forms signed off so that we can get them authenticated. After that we spent a couple of hours at Nina's doing our devos and I read an article for a little bit. After that we spent a couple of hours at Arianne's house. We had travel physicals which we thought were for everything we needed for our medical exam for China but discovered that we actually need regular physicals. So we got some shots and scheduled some appointments. ANd then we spent the evening laying around the house and reading. It was a great way to spend the evening

### [[January 9th, 2020, Thursday]]

Today I began my day with a burrito & devos, which I think was the beset way to start my day.  I worked and I feel like I had the most productive day in about a month. It felt good to really get stuff done. After work I did a workout in the gym at work and it felt really good to push myself. Tonight Taylor and I went to all you can eat sushi at Kyotos and it was SO good. I ate a ton of sushi, but I also didn't feel stuffed, which is nice. I feel like when I have all you can eat I usually eat way too much. It is almost 10 and I am REAL tired so I am gonna wrap up here and head to bed for the night. ✌️

### [[January 8th, 2020, Wednesday]]

This morning I left the house much later than I had intended and I feel like the rest of day was severally impacted by that. Tomorrow I am going to get out of bed as soon as the first alarm goes off so that I can be productive in the areas that I need to be. Work today was good. I finished what I could do for the in app purchase stuff as we are switching our priority to focus on 3 main features and anything that isn't pushing us towards those and isn't required for compliance is getting de-prioritized for the time being. Taylor and I had the chance to talk with Jeff after dinner tonight and it was nice to get some good encouragement from him

### [[January 7th, 2020, Tuesday]]

This morning I woke up later than I intended. I have a tough time waking up when my alarm goes off in the morning and I know that really affects how I spend my morning. Work was alright today. I am working on in app purchase stuff again, which I thought I was rid of. But after I am finished with this stuff I get to work on the new quick bets feature which I am confident will be a fun feature to work on. I called Grayson after work and got some more clarity about how to fill out some of the forms that we need to do. I think we should be able to send in our application for the school this week. Taylor and I spent some time talking about what it will look like when we go to China and how much flights are. Taylor surprised me by making steaks for dinner. They were SO good. After dinner we spent some time cleaning our room because it was still super messy from all of the stuff that we moved back from when we were dog sitting. While we were cleaning I put a couple of pieces of clothing in the donation bags. Now we are getting ready to head to bed because Taylor works early tomorrow.

### [[January 6th, 2020, Monday]]

Today was a very meh kind of day. I didn't feel very motivated and felt like I floated through the day. I don't feel like I accomplished much. The bast part of my day was for sure laying down and watching a movie with Taylor. It has been a while since we have been able to cuddle and watch a movie

### [[January 5th, 2020, Sunday]]

Today Taylor and I decided to check out Southland City Church. The pastor preached a great sermon. This is the second time we have gone there and just like when we were there for Christmas Eve last year the pastor just talked through a passage of scripture and shared what God had taught him in it and bringing life to the scripture. It was exactly how I think preaching should be done. After church Taylor and I got food and went back to Vickie's house to watch the Vikings game. It was a super intense game. Vikings won in overtime and it was a super exciting and nerve wrecking game. After the game Taylor and I went back home and are now relaxing together.

### [[January 4th, 2020, Saturday]]

This morning Taylor and I slept in which felt really nice after the pretty busy week that I have had. We started the morning slow by going to Caribou and enjoying coffee, breakfast, devos, and games together. It was pretty much my favorite way to spend the morning. Then we came home and had lunch and more games. We went to the gym and I got a good full body workout in. It is the same workout that I failed to complete last week. It felt really good to actually complete it this time. Taylor did a really intense 600 rep leg workout that I am really proud of her for completing. Then we went to Hyvee and got protein shakes and I got some sushi. Taylor had a work party that she went to and I stayed at home and tried to work on some design. I initially tried designing a photography website but quickly realized that those are far more difficult than I thought. So I tried to do a todo app instead and I honestly still found that hard. I feel like it is gonna take a lot more practice until I am designing things that are truly creative and that look great. When Taylor got home we laid down and watched Once Upon A Time for a little bit and now we are getting ready for bed

### [[January 3rd, 2020, Friday]]

This morning I did my devos at Caribou before work. I really liked taking the time to do them at Caribou rather than just doing them at home. I might make that a more regular thing. I had a pretty busy day at work and felt like I was constantly either working on a task or talking with a coworker. So there was much less down time than there normally is. Taylor had dinner cooking when I got home which is always a very welcome surprise. After dinner we played a few games and then watched a couple of episodes of Once Upon A Time. This was the first time that we have been able to cuddle up while watching tv at Vickie's and it was soooooo nice. I love cuddling with Taylor. Now we are getting ready to head to bed. I am looking forward to having a good day tomorrow

### [[January 28th, 2020, Tuesday]]

Today wasn't too crazy of a day. When I got home from work Taylor had dinner ready and that was a really nice thing to come home to, especially since I had to stay at work late. After dinner we went to the gym and after the gym [[Taylor]] read me some of the writing that she did today. I love hearing the things that she writes. I think she is such a good writer and what she is writing is really going to make an impact on so many people someday. I literally couldn't be more proud. One of the chapters is about her process of learning to love and be loved and she opened the chapter by saying a lot of super nice things about me. It was really amazing to hear ❤️

### [[February 4th, 2020, Tuesday]]

Tonight we found out that Josiah and Moriah will for sure be moving into the Ewing's house so we for sure have to move out. This is probably the most sad that I have been in a while. I really don't want to move out. I really really like living here. But I also know that we eventually have to move forward with our lives. We looked at some apartments. I needed it to feel less like we are getting kicked out of the house and more like we are moving forward to something. I don't know. I feel like I have a lot of complicated emotions about this. I don't really know how to feel about moving forward with our lives. We have been saying "after China" for so long. Now we have to make decisions for our now. And I'm not really sure about how to do that.

### [[February 5th, 2020, Wednesday]]

Today was an interesting day at work Nathanial told us that he will be moving some of us around onto different projects again. This time I am one of the ones getting moved and I am being put on a RMG web app. It is finally a thing that will involve people gambling real money, and I really don't like that. I am not about taking advantage of people and that is what this feels like. I really hope I hear back from the guy at [[Ameriprise]] soon. I would love to get out of that situation. [[Taylor]] and I have been looking at a lot of apartments today. It still feels crazy that we are moving. But looking at apartments does make me feel a little more okay with it. We also looked at dogs for a little bit

### [[February 9th, 2020, Sunday]]

There was a pretty big [[Snow]] storm today. Instead of going to [[Southland City Church]] [[Taylor]] and I just went to the [[Eagan Campus]] of [[River Valley Church]] with the [[Ewing]] family. Today [[Amelia Ewing]] got baptized and it was such a special moment. We went out to lunch with them after church. When we got home from lunch I played [[Destiny 2]] with [[Charlie Ewing]] for a couple of hours. Then [[Taylor]] and I played some card games. After that ate dinner with the [[Ewing]]s. After dinner I read [[1982]] for a little bit. Then we had a family meeting and then played [[Uno]] for a while.

### [[April 27th, 2021, Tuesday]]

I got the [[COVID]] [[Vaccine]] yesterday. my day today consisted of laying on the couch, watching tv, and resting. I also got smart blocks set up in roam

### [[February 2nd, 2020, Sunday]]

Last night [[Taylor]] was at the hotel with [[Arianne Richards]] and [[Mara St Pierre]]. They had a great time together. This morning I met [[Taylor]] at Arianne's house to go to church together. Pastor [[CJ Johnson]] preached a great message at church today. He spoke out of [[1 Corinthians]] and it was really a great message. He challenged us to be firm, but not offensive. It was an energizing message to hear. We also signed up for the [[XO Conference]]. I am excited that we will be in town to be able to attend this great conference! It will be a great way to invest in our marriage. We did the [[Enneagram]] test with the [[Ewing]] family. It was fun and everyone really enjoyed learning a little more about themselves. After that we watched the [[Superbowl]] together. The [[Kansas City Chiefs]] won. It was their first [[Superbowl]] in like 50 years.

### [[March 5th, 2020, Thursday]]

Today I found it pretty difficult to focus on [[Work]]. I think that i am just frustrated with the project that I am working on right now. When I am frustrated I I find it difficult to focus on work. Just a little observation about [[Me]]. We watched the [[Taylor Swift]] documentary and it was really interesting. She has really been through a lot and I gained a lot of respect just seeing some of what she has been through and learning more about her values. Today [[Elizabeth Warren]] dropped out of the running for [[President]]. It is a huge bummer because I feel that she was the one that was best suited for the job and it really shows that America doesn't believe in women.

### [[January 27th, 2020, Monday]]

Tonight I hung out with [[Jake Stachel]]. He shared some stories from [[Sam Tupy]]'s wedding and we talked a lot about [[China]] stuff.

### [[January 2nd, 2020, Thursday]]

This morning I did my devos. I decided to start a read the Bible in a year plan which is around 4 or 5 chapters a day. I want to learn a grow quickly in my relationship with God and this is something that I really hope will help me. Work today was decent. We moved into a new office in our building today. It is way bigger than we need for the current size of our team. Our boss is pretty sure that we will grow into it though. Today at work they said that they could see all of the devs that are in the office eventually leading offshore teams. I don't understand why they wouldn't just expand our onshore team. Taylor and I went to the gym and I did a 15 minute workout on the bike. It was more work than I expected it to be. Felt good to get a workout in. Then Taylor and I got Chipotle for dinner, I read for a while and then we played a game, watched a movie and now we are getting ready for bed.

### [[January 1st, 2020, Wednesday]]

Tonight Taylor and I had a really good conversation about the goals that I have and how I want to achieve them. She opened up the opportunity for me to take some time to work on my goals in the evening, I just need to do a better job of saying that I want to take some time to work on them. I really appreciated that she opened that conversation

This afternoon I hung out with [[Noah Korger]] It was great to spend some time with him. We talked a lot, played a lot of Smash Bros, and ate Chiptole. It was great to get some time with him. He lives in Fargo now so we don't get to hang out as much as we used to
