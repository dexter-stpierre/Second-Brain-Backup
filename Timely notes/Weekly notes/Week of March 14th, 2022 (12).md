# Week of March 14th, 2022 (12)

[[Timely notes/Weekly notes/Week of March 7th, 2022 (11)|<<Previous Week]] | [[Timely notes/Weekly notes/Week of March 21st, 2022 (13)|Next Week>>]]

## [[Plan]]

- [x] Move Discover Weekly to a permanent playlist
- [x] Review goals
- [x] Review tasks scheduled for this week
- [x] Review calendar
- [x] Review task list and schedule any tasks that should be completed this week
- [x] Review Waiting For
- [x] Schedule gym days

### Most Important Goals This Week:

Finish the last of the messages fast follows

Transfer money to Escrow account

Start using YNAB again

### What Deadlines Do I Have Coming Up?

Messages fast follows scheduled for Monday next week (likely pushing back to mid week)

Cooper coming on Wednesday next week. Anything we need to do to get ready needs to be done before then

### How Well Am I Keeping up with All My Obligations?

I feel like I am doing good. I haven't always kept up on my deadlines, but scope creep has been brutal. I'm looking forward to that not happening as much on future projects

### Are There Any New Projects I Have Time to Start Working On?

Not at this time. I feel like I need to just be consistent on the things that I want to do for myself

## Progress

## [[Review]]

- [x] Brain dump
- [x] Process Inbox
- [x] Review Calendar
- [x] Empty downloads/desktop folders

### What Went Well?

- Got the üëç for the release of messages
- Finished [[Last Arguments of Kings]]
- Started focusing on reading [[Atomic Habits]]
- Dinner with Josh and Marie
- Spring is really here!

### What Didn't Go Well?

- Taylor's cousin Oooper died by suicide
- I felt like I had no patience for Dharmishta
- There was a major bug for messages that was found towards the end of day on Friday. Thankfully it was an easy fix and I was able to take care of it quickly
- I felt like I wasn't able to get [[Sonarqube]] figured out. I am happy that I Iain will be back so I can bounce some questions off of him
- Taylor and I weren't super in sync this weekend

### What Should I Change?

- I'm unsure. I feel like I need to achieve a greater sense of clarity. Maybe adding some meditation back into my routine would be a good idea.

### [[Accomplishment]]

- Green light for messages release
- Finished a book
- Adjusted the layouts to accept an optional prop that allows the consumer to configure when different layouts hit. It's just a simple value that replaces the build in breakpoints. [[Guillaume Paugam]] was particularly excited about it, as it was to allow one of his layouts to work

### [[Failures]]

- Short patience
- Some pretty big messages bugs
- We had to pull the first and possibly the second day of the rollout off the table
