### Most Important Goals This Week:

I am going to refuse to reschedule tasks this week. I am too relaxed about just infinitely rescheduling tasks and never getting them done. So anything left at the end of the week will just be moved to a project where I can keep them, and decide whether or not to reschedule it during my next weekly review

### What Deadlines Do I Have Coming Up?

Josie mentioned that work should stop on messages tweaks after next friday. But after she said that she pushed back the release date by a week. So I think I'll have until at least the middle of next week to wrap things up

### How Well Am I Keeping up with All My Obligations?

I don't think I am keeping up very well at all. I feel like our finances are in shambles, I am behind of stuff for work, and I have so many things to follow up on this morning. So I am feeling a little bit stressed about all of that.

### Are There Any New Projects I Have Time to Start Working On?

I am starting the Couch to 5K running plan this week! I am really excited to have a more formal running plan to follow.
