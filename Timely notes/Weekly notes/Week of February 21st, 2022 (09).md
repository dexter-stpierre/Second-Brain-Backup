### What Went Well?

I got dev complete on messages. Felt really good to be complete on the project. It has been a long time coming, and finishing it is a big deal. Some small things to work through for the fast follows, but nothing too terrible. We pretty much followed the meal plan, which is rare for us. We switched up one soup and did pasta instead, but that's fine. Usually not following means going out to eat instead, so switching for a different home meal is a big deal. Hanging out with Nat and Ginge was super fun. It is always a good time when we hangout with them. After some drama Taylor's dad will be coming to the gender reveal, so that's good.

### What Didn't Go Well?

Well there is a war that broke out in Ukraine. That is scary and really not good. It's wild to see the amount of people who have said that Ukraine is in the wrong and we should join with Russia. I never thought I would see an American say that, but Trump has said that Putin is a genius and what he is doing is great. He even said that we should do something similar on our southern border. Scary stuff. The messages backend got delayed because we didn't want to release with Slack down because if something goes wrong we want to be able to communicate. This week Chad and Larry both have some time off which means we won't release messages until Wednesday or Thursday, which means the front end won't go until next week. Taylor's dad said that he wasn't going to come to the gender reveal, but CJ got him to change his mind. I think him saying that he wasn't going to come still made a mark on Taylor which will take some time for her to be okay from.

### What Should I Change?

I need to find a way to focus on my work. This last week I think it was valid to be mega distracted, but at some point I need to be able to work. That's what I get paid for. I think using Todoist more heavily will help. Some people in the Readwise slack have also been talking about a tool that would allow me to do time blocking and have my tasks from Todoist sync in. I think this would help me to be able to take a look at what is actually reasonable to complete

### [[Accomplishment]]

- Dev complete on messages rewrite
- Followed meal plan
- Doing my weekly review today.
- Got time this weekend away from doom scrolling

### [[Failures]]

- Pretty distracted at the end of this week (war in Ukraine, I think this is valid)
- Lots of small pushbacks from messages rewrite. Many of them going to Fast Follows epic.
- Let myself get sucked into Doom scrolling. Maybe I should timebox myself when I want to catch up on what is happening
