# Week of November 28th, 2021 (49)

## Review

### Thoughts

This week I have felt really off. I feel like I haven't been productive at the level that I would prefer. I feel like I'm not staying focused like I would like to. I think that I should block twitter and and tweetdeck and remove all breaks from Focus. I have a phone, iPad, and another laptop that I can use if I really need to check something. I think this will help me reclaim those small moments when a build is running. I would prefer if my distractions were at least more beneficial like reading a book, or reading an article in Reader.
