### What Went Well?

Got a lot done. Was hyper focused most of the week and it allowed me to produce some high quality work. Worked well with Luke to determine things that needed to be fixed as we went and was able to do so quickly.

### What Didn't Go Well?

I felt pretty stressed and on edge at the end of most work days. I think there's just too much of this project that has waited until the end, and that has caused me to feel pretty stressed about it.

### What Should I Change?

I wish I had some way to better handle the work that needs to get done without getting stressed. I feel like actually using Todoist as I go through my work day would be helpful
