### What Went Well?

Had our 16 week checkup and baby is healthy!

I finished the 3 column layout and the other devs seemed to really like and appreciate it

Read a little bit

Saw my first Broadway musical!

I feel like I connected with people really well this last week

I had long periods of focus, which felt really nice to have

Nat and Ginge are having a girl!

### What Didn't Go Well?

Scope creep in messages fast follows left be a little behind of where I'd like to be. But I have a good list of things to finish for the paginated messages, which will allow me to approach today with an actual plan

### What Should I Change?

I think I should start tasks by creating a list of tasks in Todoist that need to be accomplished for the ticket to be done. I think this is really helping me in tackling the paginated messages task

I'd like to make more time for reading. And for reading things that will help me learn, not just reading for fun

### [[Accomplishment]]

Fist messages release!

Finished the 3 column layout

Created a good pattern for paginated lists that will make future handling of them exponentially easier

Made if through our 16 week checkup!

Made it to the gym 3x

Saw first Broadway musical!

### [[Failures]]

Didn't finish all of messages due to scope creep
