### [[Accomplishment]]

- I wrote, what I think is, a very good doc for the [[MUI5 Migration]]. I think it will really help the other devs understand what I did, and how to approach things moving forward
- Followed the meal plan for the most part. We ate all the scheduled meals, and didn't do any additional eating out
- Got into the summer ultimate league

### [[Failures]]

- I feel like I've done a bad job sticking to our budget. I'd really like to change the way that we budget. I hope that Taylor is receptive to that
- I didn't do a good job planning our Mother's Day celebrations

### What Should I Change?

- I wanna change the way we budget. I'm getting paid while we are in Texas and Taylor is planning to handle expenses while we are there. That should be enough time for all my transactions to finish processing, which should put me in a good spot to start budgeting

### How Did I Stack Up Against My Goals For the Week?

I did finish the migration, but I didn't paint the baby room. We decided to deprioritize it, so that's okay.

### Events

- Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness
- Mother's Day
- 24 week baby appointment
- Bella's volleyball game
- Got into the summer ultimate league
