### [[Failures]]

- I felt really stressed when I was receiving so many messages of things that needed to be fixed for the messages tweaks release. I need a better was of taking in that information and tracking & prioritizing it. I feel like using Todoist more consistently would really help with that.

### What Should I Change?

Start using Todoist better

### How Did I Stack Up Against My Goals For the Week?

I didn't do my planning last week, so I didn't end up setting goals. But I finished the messages tweaks, which probably would have been one of my big goals. I also took time to relax, which was a very big goal for me this week
