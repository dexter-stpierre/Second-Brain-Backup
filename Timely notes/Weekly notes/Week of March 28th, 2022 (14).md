### What Went Well?

- The release of the new messages went out to 100% of parents, with no major issues
- Got testing set up for Sonarqube
- Dinner with my mom went fine
- Alexandre came into town
- Won a couple of games of chess
- We all got together at Rosey and Mara's
- Met a bunch of coworkers at the company happy hour
- Picked up a glider for the baby

### What Didn't Go Well?

- Taylor's SIM card broke, which was really frustrating to get fix
- I spent a lot of time looking at the feedback channel for messages in Slack. I think seeing all of the negative comments really affected me. I need to just let the product team evaluate those, and follow their lead with what changes need to be implemented
- I felt really down most days
- I felt fairly distracted at work

### What Should I Change?

- I think I need a break, and to get away. I am really looking forward to having all of next week off, and to just get away for a little while.
- I should really start meditating. I think it would go a really long way for helping me to be more focused, and less sad

### [[Accomplishment]]

- Messages rolled out to 100% of parents 
- Got the first piece of furniture for the baby (a glider)
- Tests set up with Sonarqube

### [[Failures]]

- Let myself get steamrolled with messages feedback, when the fact is that multiple tens of thousands of people have been using it without issues.
