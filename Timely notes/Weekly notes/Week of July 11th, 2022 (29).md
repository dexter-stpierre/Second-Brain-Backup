### [[Failures]]

- Had the wrong size rod for the holders that I had for the closet
- Didn't get the floor transition piece on right
- Didn't double check that the screws I had would fit the shelfs for the nursery. They didn't
- Wasn't focused during work at all

### What Should I Change?

Not sure. I think I'm starting to get into a bit of a slide with work. Which isn't great because I still have a couple of projects to do before I go on parental leave. Maybe starting out by picking one or two things that I wanna get done that day will be helpful.

### How Did I Stack Up Against My Goals For the Week?

Not great

### Events

- Birthday Red Robin with the Richards
- Dinner with Sophia and Haris
- Ultimate game, Taylor came with and we had fun at Granite City after
- Appointment with a dietician to figure out how to manage Taylor's gestational diabetes.
