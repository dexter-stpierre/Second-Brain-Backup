### What Went Well?

I feel like this week I had times when I was very zero'd in. I felt productive, and I was getting a lot done. I really liked that. 

The wild game and sushi with Jack was really fun. So was getting to tell him about the baby. He was seriously so excited for us, and I think he is gonna be a huge source of support for me as we have this baby.

I figured out how to get Plan to Eat to show up in my calendar, I feel like that was a huge win. It's nice to see events, tasks, and meals all in the same place and be able to turn some off when I want less noise

Meeting the new Lead React Engineer went well. I feel like him and I got along well and that he will bring a lot of good ideas to the team and take us to that next level.

Meeting with Thomas was good. He is an aspiring web dev and it was fun to get together with someone who is just beginning on that journey. I hope that I am able to guide him well

We mostly ate the meals that I had planned, so that's good. There was only one that we didn't eat, and that was because Taylor ended up making dinner plans

### What Didn't Go Well?

While I did have times of good focus I had more times where my focus was very broken. I wish I could get into a sweet spot of having great focus for a couple hours a day. I feel like that is all I would need to be extremely productive

I felt like I didn't know how to let myself be a priority. I put so much effort into taking care of Taylor and I feel like I can't say no to anything or change anything to do what's best for me.

### What Should I Change?

I need to try something new with how I approach work. I'm debating starting earlier, that used to be a great way for me to be very productive. I also find myself being the most productive at the end of my workday, so maybe working until 4 could be a good solution. Maybe putting my phone in my backpack instead of on my desk would be a good idea, out of sight out of mind. I can still do everything important that I need to right on my computer.

### [[Accomplishment]]

Ate what we had planned

Both Luke and Matt, the new Lead React Engineer, gave me really good feedback. That felt really great to receive 

### [[Failures]]

My focus sucked most of the time. I need to figure out how to shore that up. I've removed a lot of distractions and it still isn't helping.
