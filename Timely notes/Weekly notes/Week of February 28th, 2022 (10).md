### What Went Well?

I made some more good progress on the messages fast follows. I was able to focus way more than I was the week before. I did good work on the 3 column layout, which will be really beneficial for the whole team. The API release went out and seems to be stable. There was one small issue, but it doesn't seem to be related to the message board release. This next week we are releasing the React side, I really hope that it goes well. I collaborated quite a bit with my team this week, between a couple of ad hoc meetings to get people's opinions on things, and bringing up some topics in the guild meeting. I think it was a major win. Moved messages into preprod

Taylor and I got along pretty well this week. We had a couple of rocky moments, but nothing too bad

Saw Batman with Jack and it was great! I really enjoyed that movie. Jack will also be going to see Waitress with us this week, so that will be fun

### What Didn't Go Well?

Friday I wasn't super productive. I got pretty annoyed with Dharmishta, and I think it might have been unreasonable. I think I need to figure out how to work with more grace when working with someone I don't jive with.

Having Bella and Makenna stay with us wasn't fun. I think they are just past the age where it is fun to have them stay with us and now it is just annoying. I think we will have less sleepovers with them.

Rosendo was VERY frustrating to talk about Waitress with. His communication sucks and it is very frustrating, especially when trying to set up plans.

### What Should I Change?

I'd like to start having more meaningful breaks while working. I feel like I have a lot of ad hoc breaks that don't refresh me. I think takings scheduled breaks that I spend mindfully would be more beneficial.

I want to do something special for Taylor this week, but I'm not sure what yet

### [[Accomplishment]]

- Moving messages into pre-prod
- Brought up topics in the React Guild that were impactful and everyone enjoyed talking about. I think the solutions we will come up with out of that discussion will greatly improve our code base.
- Nice message from [[Josie Wittwer]]

### [[Failures]]

- Had little patience with a frustrating coworker
- I feel like I didn't prioritize my priorities. And maybe I haven't been doing that for a while. That's something that I want to get better at
