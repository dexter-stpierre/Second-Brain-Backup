### [[Accomplishment]]

- Considering writing a OSS NPM package to dynamically create a server for MSW based on a Swagger document
- Drove the entire drive both ways on our trip to [[Lawrence, KS]]

### [[Failures]]

- Didn't accomplish a ton at work
- Didn't even do a weekly review last week
- DIdn't keep up on tasks in [[Todoist]]
- Forgot to save my discover weekly, and I actually really liked that one

### What Should I Change?

I've still not been able to be very productive at work. I might start keeping my phone in my backpack while I am working. I can still respond to important texts from Taylor, but I'll avoid getting distracted by things like my chess game

Maybe there is a different way I can set up my screen time to make certain apps blocked during the day. Otherwise I can maybe leverage OneSec for that

### Events

- Grill out with the Richards
- Went to [[Lawrence, KS]] to be at [[George Fletcher]]'s grad party
