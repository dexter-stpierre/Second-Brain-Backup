### What Went Well?

Friday I got a good amount of work done. I think if I gave myself made up deadlines and held myself to them then I could really get some shit done. I remembered to call my mom on her birthday, so I feel like that's an accomplishment. And I went to the gym on all 3 days that I planned to! Don't think I've done that yet this year. I think I'd like to get a pair of gym shoes and do 2 climbing days and 3 weight training days / week. 

I also got my journals move from Roam to Obsidian. That completes my process of migrating to Roam, and I got to close out a Todoist project. 

### What Didn't Go Well?

I still haven't been super focused at work. I need to get better at managing my time and focus. I haven't been very good at that. I also upset Taylor a couple of times and I feel badly about that

### What Should I Change?

I should consider using a pomodoro timer to keep myself focused. I think that if I sit and intend to focus on one thing for a defined period of time I could handle that better.
