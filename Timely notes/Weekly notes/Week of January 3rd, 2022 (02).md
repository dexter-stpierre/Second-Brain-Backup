### What Went Well?

Towards the end of the week I was able to focus on my work much better. I think just being in the mindset of working again instead of vacation mode will make this week much easier. We took the Christmas decorations down, it was super quick to take them down, and not painful. However our house feels pretty plain now. I went to the gym twice this week, which is better than before. I also read 30 minutes most days this week. I think I only had one or two energy drinks, I made coffee most days. We had a dinner and movie date on Tuesday. We told [[Rosendo St Pierre]] and [[Mara St Pierre]] about the baby, they were very excited. I guess we also told [[Arianne Richards]] and her family this week as well. I would say that overall I did pretty good working towards my goals this week

### What Didn't Go Well?

I didn't do a good job getting my workouts in. I skipped one of my scheduled gym days, and didn't workout at home most of the non-gym days. I'd like to get better at that. I didn't ~~spend time with a friend~~(I hungout with Nathan Krawza) or spend time learning something that interests me. I should maybe mention those goals to Taylor, as those will have an impact on out time

Also, the heating fix was much more expensive than expected. It was $980, so that was a huge bummer

### What Should I Change?

I should choose a specific time to do my at home workouts. This will help make sure that I do it everyday. I think that my work focus will naturally improve this week, so I don't really feel like I need to do anything there.

I think I'd like to start getting to bed a little earlier. We have been going to bed around 11-11:30, and I feel like that is just too late. I'd like to be getting to bed more around 10:30

### [[Accomplishment]]

I would rate following most of my goals the first week of the year as a significant success.

I set up YNAB, even though I wasn't good about using it.

### [[Failures]]

Not tracking things well in YNAB

Lack of focus at work
