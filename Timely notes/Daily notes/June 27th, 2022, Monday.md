Well we were supposed to go out on the boat today, but Taylor wasn't feeling good last night, and woke up not feeling good this morning, and it turns out that she has covid. So I ended up working anyways. I figured out how to get the server to handle join and the pages that have React imbedded in the legacy app. I ended up digging through plugins that did similar things and was able to create my own plugin that did exactly what I wanted it to. So that's really good. I'm proud of myself. Tomorrow I'll clean that up while I am working on some other things. I'll also need to update the legacy app to make the script tags that import the react scripts into modules. Should be easy enough.
