This morning Taylor worked at Caribou at 6. We got up so early I didn't have the mental energy to make good use of my time. Maybe when she works that early I should be disciplined at making a cup of coffee, sitting down at the dining room table, and having 1 or 2 easy tasks lined up that I have been wanting to do but putting off. That feels like it would be a really good use of my time. Today I spent some time digging into Sonarqube, but to be honest I am still really unsure of how to make it work. It feels like a pretty complicated piece of software, and like it plays much nicer with Java than JavaScript. Dharmishta found a bug that was causing the page to crash. Basically a custom hook was continuously rerendering because I was passing an empty array directly into the hook instead of creating a variable that had a reference to a consistent array. So the array was always different, so the useEffect hook kept running. It wasn't super easy to identify, but it was pretty easy to fix. I also had to respond to many messages from QA, most of which were either pre existing bugs, or clarifying questions on functionality. Thankfully there was nothing that should prevent Monday's release and the subsequent rollout! 

Tonight Taylor and I got dinner at Chipotle and then sent to Target, Menards, Trader Joes, and got Frozen yogurt. It was a busy, and really fun night. I am really glad that we did all of those things and just enjoyed spending time together. We also purchased the new track packs for Mario Kart and played through both of the new Grand Prix twice
