This morning it was impossible for me to get out of bed. I couldn't even keep my eyes open. Once I finally got out of bed I read for almost an hour. We had our final ultra sound today, and it was good. He's growing exactly on track. We actually really liked the doctor that we had today. She was really caring, and took time to answer all of our questions, and made sure that we were clear on what the next few weeks looks like. So that was nice. I got a couple of bugs done at work. Taylor had the HepB swab done today, and shortly after it started hurting to pee, so we went to urgent care and it turns out that she has a UTI. So that sucks. We took Betty to the dog park and she was pretty weird around the other dogs. I think it is mostly because she hasn't been to the dog park in a while.
