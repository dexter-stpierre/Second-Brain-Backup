Today was a tough day for me. With the war in Ukraine I am having a hard time not just doom scrolling. There are so many fucked up things happening around the world, and it is all weighing on me. I told Taylor that I want to try to not spend too much time on my computer and iPad this weekend. I need a little break from all of it. I literally did nothing at work today. I am not proud of that fact. I want to do a good job at work. It is hard when it feels like everything is crashing down around us.

On a slightly brighter note, Elden Ring came out today and I found out it is on Xbox. I got it and played for a couple hours. That is a challenging game
