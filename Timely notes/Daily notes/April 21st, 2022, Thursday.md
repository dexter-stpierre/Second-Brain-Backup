This morning I had a 1:1 with [[Josie Wittwer]]. I brought up a promotion to Sr Dev and she said that we should go through the titling doc and see how we can make me make the transition from the engineer description to the senior engineer. I honestly think I have met all of the requirements and I don't understand why I haven't gotten the promotion yet. She said that she doesn't think it will happen at my mid year review, but it is likely for my year end review. This honestly really upset me. I really feel like I deserve the promotion. I have received countless positive feedback, and never a spot of negative. I believe that I have already aligned myself with the senior engineer description. It honestly makes me want to hard core hit the job search towards the end of my parental leave. I owe it to myself to work at a place that values me, and gives me opportunities to advance, and I feel like OFW isn't doing that.

This afternoon we went and picked up a changing table for the baby! The only other major piece of furniture we have left is the crib!

Tonight I went to dinner and Return of the Jedi In Concert with [[Jack Carlson]] and his family. It was really fun.
