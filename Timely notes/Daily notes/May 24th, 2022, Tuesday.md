##### [[Did I do something that was out my comfort zone?]]

Hmmm I can't really think of anything outside of my comfort zone that I did today

#### [[Journal]]

Today was a good day. I went for a run and finished it, and it was a pretty hard one. My knees have been hurting pretty hard from it. I think I'll start doing some squats or something to try and strengthen my legs. even doing a few sets of body squats can make a noticeable difference. At work I was pretty productive. It felt like one of those days where I was just in a zone and able to be very productive. This evening we went to Target to get some stuff that I forgot to get, then ate Fajitas for dinner, and then went for a walk. We took Sophia and Haris' dog for a walk because they are in the hospital right now because Sophia has a uterine infection. Spent about 45 minutes reading and I am really grateful that I got that time
