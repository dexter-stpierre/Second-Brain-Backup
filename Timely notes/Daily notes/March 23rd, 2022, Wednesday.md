I need to figure out a better way to handle this. Maybe a simple template with sections could be better, and a free form entry about how I'm feeling, any special about the day, that sort of thing

This morning I slept in and made myself a cup of coffee. I made breakfast sandwiches for breakfast. Taylor stayed home from work for one more day to finish getting better. At work we released the final fixes for Messages that were preventing roll out, and tomorrow rollout begins! So excited for our users to start using the stuff I have been working so hard on for so long. Today Cooper came over and he will be staying with us until Tuesday. We are kind of dreading it, he is a little more high maintenance than Betty is. But I'm sure we'll end up getting into something of a rhythm. Tonight we were supposed to have chicken tacos, but I forgot to take chicken out, so we had steak sandwiches instead. Tomorrow is the job fair that I am helping OFW with, and I am actually really excited about it!
