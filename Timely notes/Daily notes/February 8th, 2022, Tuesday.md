Heath and Ginger got home around 2 this morning, so they took care of getting the kids to school. It was nice to not have to worry about driving around a bunch of kids all day. We told Heath and Ginger this morning about the baby and they were both very excited! Then we drove home and I got some laundry started and started working.

Today I was focused on finishing the mobile nav for the majority of the day. This was a much trickier problem than I anticipated. But I think I found a solution that works well for me. Not sure how the solution for the mobile view message will workout with being abstracted, but maybe it doesn't need anything fancy. I also worked on Lukes notes for a little bit. Honestly the handling of a single message being selected/unselected is a little complicated. I am hoping that I have an idea in the morning, but if not I might pass on it for now and come back later. I also had a lot of meetings today, which was a huge bummer. I am hoping that I won't have many tomorrow.

Taylor had texted me this afternoon that she wanted to have pasta for dinner. She texted me that right when I sat down to eat pasta for lunch. I felt bad, and was okay with eating it again so i didn't say anything but then when she was home and asked me what I had for lunch she didn't want me to eat pasta twice, and was kind of upset that I didn't just say that I had eaten it for lunch. I had my first haircut in a long time today. I was honestly pretty anxious about it. A little anxious before, very anxious during, and quite a bit anxious after. I am not used to feeling that way. I also feel like Taylor doesn't like it, she hasn't said once that it looks goodâ€¦
