This morning I went to the gym and ran a mile. I haven't done that in over a week, so it felt really good to do today. At work I was a little more productive than I have been on recent days. I got the coverage report uploading to Sonarqube. I am taking tomorrow off to hangout with Alexandre since he already had the day off

Alexandre arrived tonight. Him and I hungout and talked for a few hours tonight. We are going to hangout all day tomorrow too, and go to the happy hour for work. We talked a little bit about a girl that he is interested in and when he was talking about working through whether or not to see her he kept on saying "we", meaning him and our parents, thought this or that. I thought that was pretty weird. At the end of the day the most important thing is what he thinks. I think my parents can give advice, but if he feels like they are coming to a joint decision about his life, I think that is weird. He did say that he stood up to my dad when he made a comment that he didn't like about kids moving back home and I am really proud of him for standing up to him in that way. I know that it isn't super easy for him.
