- For my [[1:1]] with [[Josie Wittwer]] today she asked me share motivators and demotivators. The meeting was rescheduled. I will add a link to the new date once I get the invite
    - Motivators:
        - Greenfield projects
            - Working on something new makes me feel energized and like I am making a real impact
        - Seeing the impact of past projects
            - Knowing that the things that I am working on is actually improving people's lives and making a difference
        - Getting to try new things
            - I love the opportunity to learn new skills so I always love when I get the opportunity to branch out into something new, like I did with testing and Storybook
        - Trust/autonomy
            - When I know that I am being trusted to take on the project and see it through it energizes me and I 
    - Demotivators
        - Context switching
            - I have a hard time loading and unloading contexts, so I prefer being able to stay focused. Meetings are particularly frustrating and having them more batched, or closer to a lunch, where a break in focus is natural helps a lot.
        - Lack of context for decisions
            - When we do things just for the sake of doing them, or because it is the "process" can be particularly frustrating. Having more context around how a process makes things better for me, or a coworker, and ultimately pushes us towards our goals
        - Long project horizons
            - Waiting a long time to be able to deploy out the code I am working on. Makes it difficult to truly collaborate on projects with the other devs
        - Micromanagement
            - This isn't really an issue at [[OFW]], thankfully
        - Not knowing what's next
            - At the start of my time at [[OFW]] there was a chunk of time that I had not project I was working on. Requirements for the next project were being worked on and I was in a sort of limbo and I worry about being in that spot again when I don't know what is coming next.
