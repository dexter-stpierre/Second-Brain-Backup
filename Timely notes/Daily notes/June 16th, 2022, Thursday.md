This morning I went for my first real [[Bike Ride]] of the summer. I biked down to Lake Como and back. I wanted to get a lap around the lake in, but I barely had the time and energy to do what I did, so turning back was the right call. Tomorrow I think I'm gonna take some of my pre workout, and try to do a lap. Then I'll stop at Ginko on the way home and grab breakfast. Work was pretty busy. I was finishing up a few little bugs for the release that is going to go out next week. Wasn't too bad. Had a meeting to look at new designs for the table view for messages. I am a little unsure about how I will approach things for it, considering the layouts aren't friendly for the layout as they exist today. Maybe I can make a new layout wrapper that takes the layout to be displayed as a prop, so that I can easily swap them out depending on the selected layout for messages. We had a React team happy hour. [[Lydia Fails]] came over for dinner and hungout for a little bit, then Taylor and I went on a walk and folded laundry.
