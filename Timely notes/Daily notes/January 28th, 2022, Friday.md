Today I was very unproductive at work. I feel like I had just enough meetings that my time was segmented enough that I never truly felt productive. I got a little bit done right before I signed off, but that was it. I met Matt today, he seems like a really smart guy who really cares about the work that he does. I think he will be a really great part of the team, and I am excited to see the feedback that he gives.

Taylor and I played the new game that I got her for Christmas and we had so much fun! We were laughing a ton, and just having a really good time.
