### [[Morning Routine]]

#### [[Journal]]

Last night I had a dream. In the dream the entire world was turned upside down. There were murders running around killing people, everyone was running for their life. There were bad guys of history that were resurrected to kill people. But then in my dream I ran into [[Ryan Hoyt]]. I gave him the biggest hug I've ever given anyone and I didn't want to let go. I miss him. I miss my best friend. I feel like I don't really know how to have friends since he passed. He was just such an amazing friend who I loved so much and he made such a big impact on my life. He's the only one I want to tell whenever anything exciting happens in my life. He's the only one that I want to meet my baby. I miss him so much

### [[Evening Review]]

#### [[Journal]]

I miss Ryan. I wish he was here and I could talk with him about everything happening in this crazy world. I told Taylor this morning about the dream that I had about Ryan and honestly it felt like she approached the topic different with me than she would have if I was just one of her friends. It felt like she just talked about her experiences with similar situations instead of even trying to comfort me in mine. And then she kind of just moved on from it. So I'm pretty confused about why that was.

Today we went to the Kick Off to Summer at the Fair. It was nice, we ate lots of good food. I think Taylor was pretty disappointed by it though. They had poutine though, so I was pretty stoked. Then we went grocery shopping and I made dinner
