Today was a busy day. Taylor worked at 6, so we were up around 5. I spent time just sitting around the house and scrolling on social media. I think I need to add Focus to my laptop and block social apps in the morning. I feel like that would help me zero in on things that actually matter. I drove the high schoolers to school, and Evie had the day off because her school's water main bursted, so we went to Taylor's Caribou to get a coffee.

Work was very busy. The only meeting I had was out standup and besides that I was completely focused. I finished syncing the updates to the list with the user taking actions on messages. I simply had to hoist some state and make a refresh function. At the end of the day it really wasn't all that hard. The thing that took the most time was zeroing in on what was causing so many requests to fire. It ended up being something weird, but I can't remember exactly what right now. I also worked on the usePersistentState hook, the no messages selected screen, redirects depending whether values in the url are valid, and other small fixes. The big thing I have to nail on Monday is to finish the empty folder stuff, finish mobile responsiveness, and handle the new rules for selecting messages. I also need to get the report button finished, but I think that one is small potatoes. Hopefully once those things are finalized then I should be good to start moving tasks over to QA, and handling the last few small tickets.

The afternoon was fairly stressful. Everyone needed to be somewhere and I was the only one to take them there. I ended up just having to go through 1 by 1 and get them to where they needed to go in order of importance of events.
