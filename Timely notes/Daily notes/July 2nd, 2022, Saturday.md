Well I tested positive for Covid today. This is my second time having it. This morning I felt like it was gonna end being pretty bad, but I took a shower and felt pretty much completely better after that. I bought a Pokemon game for my Switch and played that quite a bit today. I'll probably play it some tomorrow too.
