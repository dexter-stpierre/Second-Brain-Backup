Today I went to the gym and ran a mile and a half @ 5 mph. I think I am going to have a goal to be able to run a mile at 5mph without my heart rate going above 180 bpm. I think that would be a good goal, and a big improvement in my health. I got a decent amount of work done today. I was proud of what I was able to do. And tomorrow I should be able to knock out the fast follows tickets which will free me up to be able to start working on Sonarqube, which will be good. I'm looking forward to getting to work on something a little more easy going. Tonight Taylor and I mostly just sat around and watched a lot of New Girl. I both liked it and didn't like it. I was feeling pretty tired so it was nice to just sit and not do anything. However I also don't love just watching tv all night
