Today was a pretty good day. I went and got us Yum Bakery for breakfast, and it was okay. We did a budget, cleaned the fridge, and did grocery shopping. So a get stuff done for the house kind of day. While I was shopping Taylor did dishes and it was SO nice to not have to worry about them. Tomorrow Taylor goes back to work. I am going to make breakfast burritos for the week and make Taylor some ground beef and rice for her lunches. I will be making some chicken broth and chili tomorrow as well. Should be a good day.
