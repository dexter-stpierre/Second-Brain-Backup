Today was Taylor's birthday. She had breakfast with Miranda Blumberg. While they were eating I droppedBetty off at Ashley's house I then went to Byerlys for breakfast and coffee. I was really tight on time and only had 10 minutes to eat, which was pretty frustrating. We went to Laurie Youmans funeral, which is obviously a bummer of an activity on a birthday. But it was a beautiful service. We really didn't have to talk with anyone too painful, which was nice. We got to see Jesses parents, which is always a treat. Then we went to the mall and I told Taylor she could do some shopping. She got quite a few things and seemed like she really enjoyed it. We hung around in the hotel room for a while and then I went and got Bennihananas for dinner. On my way back with the food I ran into Davey and Nichole. And when we went for a walk around the mall after dinner we ran into them again. We both took baths and then watched some Friends while we went to sleep. We also answered questions from the question game that Nat and Ginge gave us. Oh, and Nat and Ginger had their baby!!
