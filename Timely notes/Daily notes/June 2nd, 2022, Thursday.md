Today I went for a run even though my legs were still super sore from ultimate on Tuesday. It was worth it to say that I was still able to do it. Much slower times, but I got it done. Work was a little hard to be motivated for. I got some stuff done, but not much. I'm gonna have to be pretty productive tomorrow to finish all my stuff for Monday.

Taylor had a rough day today. She was anxious all day and hasn't really felt the baby move. I worried about the baby, and I'm worried about her. I don't really know how to express that though. I don't want Taylor to feel like she's alone, but I also don't want her to feel like she needs to comfort me..
