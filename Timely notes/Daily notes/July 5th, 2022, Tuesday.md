### [[Evening Review]]

#### [[Journal]]

Today was an okay day. I got up and kind of did my weekly review/planning. I say kind of because I just wasn't not motivated when I did it. But I did get through it. Taylor's aunt Carol said that we probably shouldn't come to the cabin this weekend. At first she said it was because of what Mary Jo said, which was really frustrating. But then she said that she is worried about Dave, which is fair. He did have cancer. Taylor cried for a while. We have both been really looking forward to this all summer and it is really frustrating to have it taken away because of Covid. Especially since we thought we'd be far enough removed from it. If John doesn't go to the cabin on Saturday we might go out on the boat with him, and we are trying to see if we can go to Taylor's friend, Rachel's, family cabin some other time.

I got a lot done at work today. I finished quite a few tickets, and got a response from Josh about stuff for Sonarqube. The stuff for Sonarqube came after I was done for the day though, so I'll have to wait until tomorrow to act on it. Tonight I made barbecue chicken for the first time and it turned out really good! I made peppers on the grill and those turned out really well too.
