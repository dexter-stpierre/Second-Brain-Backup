This morning we woke up and left for the airport to go to Malibu! In the airport Taylor lost her denim jacket. We aren't sure if it was stolen off of her luggage, or if it fell off. It was a bummer of a way to start off the trip. On the plane there was a lady that had a dog with her. The dog literally spent the first 30 minutes of the flight yelping, until the flight attendants asked her to take the dog out of the kennel it was in. The yelping sound that it was making was one of the worst sounds I have ever heard. I wanted to play Dark Souls on the flight, but I couldn't get it to work.I just found out that apparently the A and B buttons are messed up on the Switch version, so you have to use B to accept, and A to cancel. At least I know now. When we landed we went outside and our rental car took about 30 minutes to arrive. We went to In-N-Out for lunch. Then we drove out to our Airbnb. It is pretty far up in the mountains, and the roads are ridiculously windy. We got up here, and then found out that we couldn't get our room right away. So we went back down the mountain and to a town to get some food at Target, and some Chipotle. Then we went back up the mountain to the airbnb. We played bags, and played some card games and then read for a while. Then we watched some Friends, and now it is time for bed
