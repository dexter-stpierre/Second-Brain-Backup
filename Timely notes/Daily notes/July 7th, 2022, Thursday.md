Today was a good day. I went for a bike ride this morning and did 3 laps around Lake Como, which felt really nice. It wasn't too hard, and I felt very accomplished after. I took a Covid test today and it was positive again. Josh and Jack both didn't feel comfortable going to the movie with me because of it, so I cancelled the tickets. Thankfully I was able to get my money back. Work was fine, I spent a good amount of the time working through an issue with react-pdf. Tomorrow I am planning on submitting a PR for the Readme to include the solution that we went with. We had a baby appointment today and got another ultrasound. It was so exciting to get to see the baby again! He has grown so much! It was honestly harder to see him on this ultrasound than it was at 20 weeks. They said he is tracking in the 60th percentile. We were also told that Taylor has gestational diabetes, which was really frustrating. Honestly the way that the midwife handled it was really shitty and dehumanizing. I think that this clinic really sucks at laying out next steps and telling us what to expect. They just kind of throwing things at us and expect us to know what to do with them. When they called Taylor to set up an appointment with a dietician they were really pushing her to take an appointment on Monday, but here day was already packed that day and they were being really harsh about it. The whole situation just feels really stupid and frustrating. I am looking forward to the baby coming so that we just don't have to worry about this stuff anymore. That's not to say that there won't be anything to worry about, we just won't have to have someone this involved with her health.
