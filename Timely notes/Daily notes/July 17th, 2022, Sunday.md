Today was a good day. I woke up a little early to go do yard work. I pulled up some more of the vines that regrew by the fence, pulled up weeds that were growing in the rocks, and mowed. It was a ton of work and I was extremely sweaty. I cleaned the fridge and freezer and went grocery shopping. I tried to hang the shelfs in the baby room, but the screws I used had heads that were too big, so tomorrow I have to go to Ace to see if they have a screw that is the right thickness, with a small enough head. Otherwise I will have to come up with another plan to get the shelfs attached to the wall. We ate Bruschetta steaks for dinner and they turned out super well
