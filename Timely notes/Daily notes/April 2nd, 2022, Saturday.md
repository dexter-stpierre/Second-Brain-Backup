This morning we slept in a little bit and then went to get Brueggers for breakfast. They had a new brisket sandwich that was excellent. After that I made the meal plan and we went grocery shopping. Then we went to Rusty Taco for lunch. That was really good, as always. Taylor and I went on a walk, and I got a mocha from Ginko. Alexandre and I played some Halo and Taylor took a nap. Then I made my balsamic vinegar chicken for dinner. We watched Grey's anatomy and now are going to bed.

I've felt pretty meh the last few days. I think it has really impacted my time with Alexandre. I think in the morning I am gonna start the day by making myself a cup of coffee, which is something that will both bring me joy to start the day, and some energy too.
