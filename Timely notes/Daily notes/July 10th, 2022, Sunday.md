Today we went for breakfast at OPH. It has been a while since we went out for breakfast and I was really wanting to. We went for lunch at the Richards. Then I went to the new Thor movie with [[Jack Carlson]] and [[Josh Pope]]. That was really fun, but they both had to leave before the post credit scene. We knew Jack had to leave, but Josh was super weird when he left. I don't know what was going on, but I really hope everything is okay. After the movie Taylor came and picked me up, and then we got dinner quick at Panera. We picked up George and Hudson and then went to drop them off at the house that Meghan was at and we picked up Meghan. Then we came back to our house and just sat around a chatted for a couple of hours and now we are heading to bed.
