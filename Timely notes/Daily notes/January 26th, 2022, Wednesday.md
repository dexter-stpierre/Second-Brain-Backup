### [[Evening Review]]

#### [[Journal]]

Today was a very productive day of work! I got a ton done. It felt so good to be so productive. I have a big day ahead of me tomorrow too though. I want to get the folder delete/name modals made, and also get Luke's entire punch list complete. I think it is a fairly reasonable goal. The only meeting I have is standup, and most of the things in Luke's punchlist are pretty easy. There is a couple that I think might take a little bit, other than that I know that I can handle it fast.

Tonight Taylor went to dinner with Ashley and I hungout at home. I had frozen chicken wings for dinner. They were good, but I felt like I ate too much. I feel like that has been a theme with me and food for a little bit and I'd like to start doing better at eating less. And maybe adding in more veggies.
