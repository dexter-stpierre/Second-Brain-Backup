Hoppy Easter! This morning Taylor and I got Caribou and went to church at [[River Valley Church]]'s Eagan campus. It was very weird to be back, but nice to see some people like the Ewings, Stephen Jelks, Thomas, Manny, and a few others. The service was fine. Nothing too awful or ridiculous was said. I didn't really enjoy the worship, but I didn't hate it either. Then we went over to [[Arianne Richards]] and [[Jesse Richards]]' house for lunch. It was fun to get together with all of the Minnesota family. Then we came home and I made hot sandwiches for dinner and we watched a couple episodes of Good Girls
