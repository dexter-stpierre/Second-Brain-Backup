Blah. I don't feel like I've been doing all that much that makes me feel a ton of joy. I have been reaching the end of a lot of days and not feeling super great. I feel like I didn't do anything that really aligns with my values, even though I don't have a super clear idea of what those are. We watched all of Schitts Creek in like 3 weeks. That wasn't anything beneficial, and doesn't make me feel great. I need to do a better job of putting myself and my priorities first. 

I played about an hour of [[Elden Ring]] tonight. I learned a lot about the game that should really help me to defeat that tough bad guy in the ruin. I remembered about the jump power attack which should help me to defeat him because I can stun him. I also created a fire bomb, which should help me too. Also making sure that I get a sneak shot to the head from as close as I can to make sure I do maximum damage. Then it's all dodge, block, and attack.

I tried to make honey walnut shrimp for dinner tonight, but the shrimp had gone bad so I made some teriyaki chicken instead.
