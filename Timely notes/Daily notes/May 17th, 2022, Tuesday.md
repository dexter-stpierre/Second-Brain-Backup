### [[Evening Review]]

#### [[Journal]]

This morning I went for a run outside. I ran up and down all the streets between here and the school down the street. There was one house on Van Buren that was really cool and I really want to show it to [[Taylor St Pierre|Taylor]].

Today at work I felt a little depressed. I'm not sure if it was because the meeting with Chad was awkward, or a different reason, but I was feeling super down. Days when I have a ton of meetings are usually super hard, and today I had 3 meetings that were spaced out very well. And when I was done with those I had a mountain of dishes to take care of. So I wasn't set up very well.

This evening Taylor and I went to pick up a coffee table from Facebook Marketplace. It is nice, and MUCH bigger than the one that we have now. I also got the AC unit in on the main level, and I might try to put the on in the office up tomorrow. I'm just really not looking forward to losing the view from my window. I wish there was another real option, but it is getting really warm in here.

I was thinking today about how I want to start writing blog posts and I think I'm gonna make a new rule for myself that when a meeting ends early I have to spend the rest of the time writing for my blog. The time was meant to be used for something besides my normal work so it feels like a fine way to spend that time.
