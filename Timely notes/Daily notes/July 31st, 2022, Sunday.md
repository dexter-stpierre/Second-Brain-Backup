This morning we went to Bread and Chocolate and Caribou for breakfast/coffee. It was pretty fun. Then I went grocery shopping. This afternoon we went to Canterbury Park because they had Corgi races. The corgis were so stinking cute. The horse races were pretty fun too, but there were super long waits in between the races. We were there for like 3 hours and only saw 6 races. And they were all under 2 minutes long. So it is mostly just a lot of sitting around. But it was still worth it for the Corgis. Maybe next time I'd bring a book though. Tonight I FaceTimed with Rosey and talked with him about project management jobs. I think it would be a great fit for it, and he would really like a job like that. It's lots of working with other's and organizing projects. I think he'd be good
