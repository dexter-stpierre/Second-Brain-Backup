This morning I went to the gym and ran a mile again. I don't think it has gotten any easier in the 2 weeks I have started running again, but I do know that I can do it, which makes finishing it a little easier. I'm looking forward to the day when running a mile isn't hard. But for now I can take pride in the fact that I am doing it. After the gym I got donuts for Taylor and I. I went to Dunkin but they were way too busy so I got the donuts at Cub Foods instead. I got some stuff done at work today, but nothing wild. And then tonight Taylor and I went on a walk, I made tacos for dinner, and we watched the first episode of Ozarks
