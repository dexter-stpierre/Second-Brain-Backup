### [[Evening Review]]

#### Prompts

##### [[What interesting ideas did I come across?]]

Read a little bit of the story of the founder of [[Notion]]. His story was starting to sounds like someone who was a normal guy, and through hard work started a massive company. And then he borrowed $150,000 from his mom to float himself while he built. Which is fine, but I just feel like no average person has started a massive startup

I learned of an app called [[One Sec]], which does exactly what I have always wanted an app to do. It makes you take a pause when opening certain apps, and can give you reminders when you have been in them for a certain amount of time.

##### [[What made me sad?]]

When we got home after dropping [[Betty]] off at [[Ashley Gibbs]]' house I expected her to run to the door to greet us, and obviously she didn't

##### [[How did I make others feel?]]

I'm not sure. The only person I really interacted with was Taylor and I feel like I didn't impact her feelings in any strong way.

#### [[Journal]]

Today was a busy day. We got breakfast at Caribou, and I did dishes. While Taylor was at [[Melina Stapp]]'s bridal shower I played [[Elden Ring]]. After that I got laundry sorted, we packed, and took [[Betty]] to [[Ashley Gibbs]]' house. Now we are gearing up to go to bed
