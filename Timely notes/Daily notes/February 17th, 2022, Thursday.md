Last night I decided not to wake up and go to the gym this morning. I woke up around 7:20 and just hungout, made myself a cup of coffee and took it easy. Work today was honestly pretty stressful. I had a lot to get done and a ton of meetings. We had the demo for messages with Bryan and Mitch today and they brought up a couple of things that might end up impacting our timelines for messages. It will be interesting to see what Nick and Josie decide based on that meeting. Taylor and I went to Target to get her some new jeans, shoes, and some other stuff. And Taylor went to Moriah Christian's house for dinner and I stayed home and took care of some dishes and laundry.
