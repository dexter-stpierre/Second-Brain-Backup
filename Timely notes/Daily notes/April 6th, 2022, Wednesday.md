Taylor worked at Caribou today. I woke up with her and then I played Elden Ring until I started work. I ended up playing for around 3 hours. I manage to kill Godrick the Grifted, which is by far the toughest boss fight I have had so far. At work today I finished the updates that were needed for messages, which felt really nice to get done. I think they are really good, and users will be happy with them. I didn't get it done quite as fast as I could have, but I'm happy enough with the speed. Right after Alexandre got off work we went to Arianne and Jesse's house and hungout with them. Alexandre played with Makenna quite a bit.

## Notes
