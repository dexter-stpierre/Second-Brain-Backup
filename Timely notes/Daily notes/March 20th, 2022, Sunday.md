I feel sad. I feel like I can't really do anything right. I feel like Taylor doesn't view me as a person that has legitimate wants and desires. When she wants something it is generally reasonable, but when I want something similar it is immature, or because I lack self control, or something else like that. I don't like feeling that way. It makes me sad.

Anyways, this morning we got Caribou and ate cinnamon rolls from Trader Joes. For lunch I made grilled cheese and we had the salad from Hyvee. I cleaned the fridge and went grocery shopping. Tonight I made an andoulli pasta for dinner. We played some games and read a little bit.
