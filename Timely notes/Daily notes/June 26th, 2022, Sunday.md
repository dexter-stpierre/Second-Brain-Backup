Today was a long day. We woke up and got coffee and breakfast and took Betty for a walk around Lake Como. After that Taylor cleaned in the house and I started on yard work. I pulled up all of the vines from the yard, 9 bags worth. It was super hard work. I started at around 10:45 and finished around 5, with an hour bread for lunch and to run to Menards for more yard waste bags. After that I took a shower and then we went to Yum and Treats. It was really nice to have a little bit of time together.
