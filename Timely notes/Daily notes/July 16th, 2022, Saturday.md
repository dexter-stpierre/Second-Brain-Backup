Today we tried to get some stuff done around the house. I tried to get the closet rod hung up in the baby room, and discovered the the rod was 1/16th of an inch too big for the holders. Then I tried to install the transition piece for the flooring in the baby room and the piece broke. Then I hung the mirror and thankfully that worked out fine. This morning we went to the farmers market and got potatoes, basil, and zucchini. We also got flowers and barbecue sauce. Then we went to dinner at Red Robin with the Richards, which is a yearly tradition that we go when Arianne, Taylor, and I all have our free birthday burger.
