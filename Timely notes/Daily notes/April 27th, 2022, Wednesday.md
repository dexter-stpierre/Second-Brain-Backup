I think I've been feeling overwhelmed lately. Like I have too much on my plate. We just got back from a vacation and I already feel a need to get away again. I am tired, and I feel kind of burnt out. I am looking forward to the time off for the baby just to have an extended period where my 8 hours a day commitment isn't present anymore.
