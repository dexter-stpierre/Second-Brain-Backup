Today Taylor and I woke up when we naturally woke up, around 8:30, and got breakfast and coffee at Caribou and ate inside and just chatted. It was a really nice way to start the day. After that I made the meal plan and went grocery shopping. I got a file box at Target so that I can start getting papers and documents more organized. I am looking forward to not having papers sitting all over my desk. I also got a new notebook that is spiral bound so that I can have it sitting out on the desk and easily be able to write in it. I am looking forward to being able to use writing more in my work. We went for a walk and I got a good amount of time to read today. Taylor did a ton of cleaning and organizing today. Yesterday Taylor called her dad to talk about the gender reveal and he said that he wasn't going to come because of Taylor's mom being there. I could tell that it really bothered. Then Terry called to say that she wasn't going to go too. Taylor was really bothered. I think partially because she doesn't like Terry, and partially just because it was super unnecessary of her to do that. But when she told CJ about it he called John and talked with him and now he is going to come. CJ is a really good guy and really sticks up for Taylor when she needs it.
