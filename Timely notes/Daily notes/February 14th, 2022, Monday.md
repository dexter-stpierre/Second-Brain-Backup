Today was the least focused day of work on the messages stuff in a little bit, and honestly I am cool with it. It has been a hectic couple of weeks and I need a little slow down. This morning I woke up around 6 and went to Caribou. I honestly wasn't focused on the weekly review, but that's okay. I went to Target to get Taylor some flowers, candles, chocolate, and breakfast. Tonight I went grocery shopping and then brought home Chipotle for dinner. Taylor made us a treat board and we watched a movie. We also announced the baby on social media, which feels unreal. We have received so much love from so many people
