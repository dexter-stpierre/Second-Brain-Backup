### [[Evening Review]]

#### [[Journal]]

Today I went to Caribou and did my weekly review. Honestly, I probably should have done a monthly review, but I didn't think about it until now. I think I will do that in between the planning meeting and the murmur sync up tomorrow.

I was very productive today, and was able to finish the folder modals and get a good chunk of the punchlist finished. Tomorrow I should be able to finish the rest of that, and also archiving before the design review.

Tonight I made burgers and they were really good. Taylor and I played some games and we spent some time doing our own things. I finished the first episode of Archive 81 and there was a crazy twist at the end. The main character's dead dad showed up and he might be the bad guy. I also read an article called The Girl In the Picture. It was a really well written article, and a very sad story. I also got to read my book for about thirty minutes.

Evidence that Trump intended to overturn the election, not to correct a fraudulent one
