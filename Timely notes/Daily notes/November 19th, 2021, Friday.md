Tonight Taylor and i went out to Murray's Steakhouse in Minneapolis to celebrate our 5 year dating anniversary. It was a really good time, we ate delicious steak and they brought us an amazing Bundt cake because I marked on our reservation that we were celebrating an anniversary. Other than that it was a pretty normal day. At work I solved a pretty difficult bug with the modal resizing on Safari and that was a huge pain. I should do a write up on how I fixed it on Monday. I also did a write up on how I solved my issue of tracking which readwise articles I have processed and I shared that on the readwise discord but it seems like no one was interested
