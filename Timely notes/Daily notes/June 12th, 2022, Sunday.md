This has been a long visit with the girls for sure. This morning I got up to make sure that they got ready for the day so that Taylor could keep sleeping. The girls were playing on their Kindles when I went to their rooms so I took them away for the day, and when they went to bed tonight I changed the password on the Kindle in their room that they had to tell the time. We took the girls to Edenborough park today, which was pretty fun
