Today was a weird day. Taylor worked at Caribou and I went back to sleep after she left. I was exhausted. I didn't wake up until almost 10, and I honestly didn't get much work done. I got a tiny bit done, but I had no focus. I did however beat the Pokemon Champion in Shining Pearl, so that was exciting. I only have a few more pokemon to find to complete the Pokedex, then I'll get the national dex. Taylor had a terrible day today. Caribou was so bad that her manager ended up quitting, she was having to work so hard. Then she went to watch Josie and she didn't want to take a nap, and Taylor ended up having a 10 hour work day. Then she came home and I didn't have the house clean. So it was just a bad day. We did go to a new restaurant for dinner though, it was called Shish, and it was super good. I am really looking forward to going again! We found out today that Laurie Youman's funeral is going to be on Taylor's birthday. So that really sucks.
