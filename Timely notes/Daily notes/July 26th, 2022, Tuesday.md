##### [[Tell me about an old friend you've lost touch with.]]

I haven't talked with Carter Adolphson in years. We were really close in high school. We went to school and church together. He'd always joke about being dumb, but i think he was guarding himself, didn't want to risk looking uncool, or having too high of expectations on him. I really liked him. He was a good guy

##### [[What was something that I did for someone else today?]]

I spent time looking into an issue for Erin. I also did many things to take care of Taylor

#### [[Journal]]

Today has felt like such a long day. This morning I made breakfast burritos for the week. At work I tried to fix the css issue by compiling all the css into a single style sheet, but that didn't work out. So we reverted back to Webpack for the release this week, so that it can go out. I think I found a good solution by simply importing the text of a css file and injecting it via emotion. I think it will be the right way to handle it. I think I will create a wrapper around the `injectGlobal` function that will take a required id and only inject it if the id isn't in an array of already injected styles. This will prevent the same styles from being injected multiple times. This route should only be taken for css files that have to be imported from node_modules. Anything that is written within out app can be converted to a css-in-js solution. This will keep the scope of this solution to only what truly needs it. I had ultimate today, and I think I had the best game of the season so far. I had a big pick, which turned into a touchdown, had a couple of good throws, and got to play handler for a little bit, which was really fun. I think I started to really understand zone defence, and even started to grasp vert stack a little bit. Lots of improvements for sure. Taylor came to the game too, which was really nice. Hana got hurt during the game though, hurt her back. I'm pretty worried about her. We still haven't gotten an update on her condition.
