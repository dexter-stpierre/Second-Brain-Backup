This morning I got up pretty early and went to the gym. I set my first alarm for 6:15 and got out of bed around 6:30, so that's really not too bad. I was moderately motivated at the gym. I was just thinking that once it is nice enough to bike, I might start working earlier, and then take an early lunch after stand up to go to the gym. I feel like that would be what will work best for my energy levels. And then of course I will eat while working, since I will have just taken like an hour for the gym.

Work was okay. I felt distracted and like I couldn't full focus. I am kind of thinking of trying to get some ADHD meds that I could take that might help me to be a little more focused. I feel like I wouldn't need anything crazy, but having something would probably lead to some pretty major improvements. 

Taylor and I mostly hung around the house tonight. I made the potato soup, and we played some games and watched the new episode of SVU. Taylor said that today was the first not hard day of work all week, which was really good to hear.
