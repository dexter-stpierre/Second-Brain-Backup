This morning I let myself sleep in a little bit, and then read for a little while. At work I made some progress on the Vite integration, which is really good. I think all I have left is ensuring that the artifacts have reliable names, figuring out how to develop on the different parts of our app, and type checking on builds. Honestly not too bad. I had ultimate tonight and the game was pretty good. We lost 7-10, but came back from 0-5, which is pretty good. I expected the heat to wear me out more than it did, I mostly just felt worn out from normal ultimate stuff. I had two pretty big defensive plays, and I had a couple of big deep catches, one of which was a touchdown, the other lead to a touchdown. I also took a couple of decent dives, which has my knee pretty fucked up
