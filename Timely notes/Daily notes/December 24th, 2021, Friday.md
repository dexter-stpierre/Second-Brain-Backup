Taylor just told me tonight that she is pregnant!!! We have been trying to have a kid for 15 months and now we finally will! She gave me a little gift box that had some baby shoes, a onesie, and the positive pregnancy test. I was so excited and start shouting. We just spent the last two hours talking about how and when we will tell different people, things that excite us and scare us about having a baby, and talking about the different ways that having this baby will change our lives. I am so excited to have this baby with her. I know that Taylor is going to be the most amazing mom and I am so excited to see her step into that role in life. And I am so excited to be a dad too.
