This morning Taylor hungout with Sophia so I had a morning of just being at home alone. It was nice, I mostly just played some [[ESO]]. Then I went to Target and did grocery shopping. When I was there I got myself some of the cheap Skull Candy bluetooth headphones, because I often wish I had headphones that I could easily carry in my pocket. When I told Taylor about them she acted like me wanting them was dumb. It made me feel a little bad. 

We spent most of the day watching football. It was the conference championship games today. The games were pretty good, both were decided by a field goal.
