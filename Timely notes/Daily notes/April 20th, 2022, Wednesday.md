I went to the gym today and it was weirdly a really hard workout. I ran for just under 3/4 of a mile, and then had to walk the rest. My wrist has been hurting so as much as I would love to do a climbing workout tomorrow I don't know if I'll be able to. At work I finished the error audit and started on the MUI 5 migration spike. I am excited to learn what I can about what our migration will look like. I noticed today that I haven't seen any sign of Matt since before the babymoon. I feel like Josie is going to tell me that he is gone in our 1:1 tomorrow. We have a job posting out for a lead react dev, which is the position that he was in. I see no reason why we would need a second lead level dev. If we are bringing on new devs I think we should bring on junior devs who we can train up. Tonight we went to the mall to get me a new outfit for the gender reveal. I told Taylor about how insecure I feel when shopping with people. She was very understanding. I ended up getting a new shirt and a pair of pants from Express, and Taylor says that she wants to get me a suit from there for Melina's wedding, which sounds great to me! Tonight we created the Facebook event for the live stream of the gender reveal and invited our family to it
