Today was fun. I got Starbucks for me and Taylor for breakfast, and then we spent the morning playing games and laying around. Then we watched the last Vikings game of the season, which they won! And then we took down the Christmas decorations and put the laundry away. I hadn't watered the tree since Christmas so basically all the needles fell off. Now we are getting ready for bed. Tomorrow I will be going to a coffee shop to do my weekly planning and review. I think that this will be a really healthy habit for me to have.
