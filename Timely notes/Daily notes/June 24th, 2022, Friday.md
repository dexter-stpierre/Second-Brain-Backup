### [[Evening Review]]

#### [[Journal]]

Today was a day that I never thought I'd see. Even when I wanted it to happen I didn't think I'd see it. SCOTUS overruled [[Roe v Wade]], abortion is no longer a right in the US. Privacy is no longer a right in the US. Bodily autonomy is no longer a right in the US. Medical freedom is no longer a right in the US. And there are people I know, and once called friends and mentors, who are celebrating this. It is horrible and disgusting. It is just such a dark and heavy day and I am exhausted.
