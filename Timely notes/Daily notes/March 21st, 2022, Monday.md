## [[Daily Pages]]

### [[Morning Routine]]

#### Prompts

#### [[How Can I Increase the Frequency of the Feedback That I get?]]

I think if I meet more regularly with [[Matt Stanton]] I could get some pretty regular feedback, and feedback that really relates to the actual work I do at my job. Maybe if we did a coworking session every other week, or I met with him when finishing a chunk of work that I was planning to share with the team

### [[What Do I Want to Be True in 12 months’ Time That isn’t True today?]]

I want to be prioritizing the things that I consider to be important. I still haven't prioritized spending time working on a course and i would really like to do that

### [[What Motivates Me to Make progress?]]

Learning new things. Seeing something be created that didn't exist before.

### [[Evening Review]]

#### [[Journal]]

This morning I went to Caribou and did my weekly review. I didn't start quite as quickly as I would have like to, but I still got the review part done. I'll do the planning part tomorrow. We released the messages fast follows today, which is good! The plan is to start rolling out the new experience to new users starting tomorrow, which is exciting! That is assuming that we get QA's approval and we don't find any major issues in the bug hunt. I struggled with getting [[Sonarqube]] to analyze TS files, but finally got it working. Sonarqube is using whatever version of TS is baked into their tool, not the version in the app. The version in their tool didn't accept on of our parameters in our tsconfig.json, and it was erroring out, but Sonarqube was giving no indication of what might be wrong.
