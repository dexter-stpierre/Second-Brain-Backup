### [[Evening Review]]

#### [[Journal]]

This morning I went to Caribou to do my weekly review. I wasn't super focused and did not finish it. I think I will finish it tomorrow. Work today was pretty chill, mostly just working through Sonarqube testing/linting. Towards the end of the day I tried getting esbuild added to the project and it was honestly pretty easy and lightning fast. I think that getting esbuild or Vite in there will make a huge difference for development speed. I know that those few seconds where I am waiting for the app to recompile are a huge loss of productivity due to distractions. We went for a walk after I was done with work and while on the walk I got a Slack message that there was an emergency fix that needed to happen with messages. Josie said that if we couldn't get a fix out tonight we might have to roll back. But the issue was literally just that the list didn't render sent messages in a discernible way, especially in the all messages folder. Nick took like 30 minutes to realize that things were built correctly to spec, and that there was just confusions in how things were displayed. It was maybe a poorly researched design, but it was not an emergency, nobody was having their data messed up or not having access to important features. I'd really like to understand what the understanding of the issue was, and how that aligned with our escalation definitions for why they were justifying an emergency evening release.

I made lettuce wraps for dinner and Alexandre helped me. Having his help was really nice, especially with the work emergency. After dinner Taylor and I watched TikToks and then we all watched the March Madness Championship game and I graded Prime assignments during it. It was a really good game.
