Today we went to Artisan to watch [[Alex Anderson]] preach his first sermon. He spoke on the importance of reading scripture with a perspective of it being both the word of God and a piece of literature. But human and divine. I think it was an excellent sermon. Taylor said that if he had his own church then she would want to attend it. I could get behind that. After church we got chilis for lunch

The whole afternoon we pretty much just sat around and did a whole lot of nothing, and honestly I appreciated it. I am missing home though, and I am really excited to get back to our own routines.
