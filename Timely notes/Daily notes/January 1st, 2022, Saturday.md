Today I felt pretty blah. We slept until 10, since we were up so late. We made breakfast with whatever we had, and then chilled. We played some games for a while, and I made chicken for lunch. We watched some tv, and then did our own thing for a little while. I decided to spend some time building a weekly page template, which I will start using on Monday. I went to get Chipotle for dinner, but both of the locations were closed so we did Wendys instead. We watched an okay movie that was based on the ideas of The Secret, which I generally consider BS. Then we played some Mario Kart and Taylor talked with Grace for a while. I hope to be able to clean out the fridge tomorrow and get groceries done. I think we will also be seeing Arianne and Jesse, and telling them about the baby

## Notes

I'd like to start setting up a template for a weekly review and daily review/planning. This would be great things to have set up for myself going into the new year. I should also eventually write templates for monthly and quarterly reviews and planning. I think these would be useful. Maybe I can get doing my quarterly and monthly planning set up for this week while I am working, or maybe on Monday while Taylor is at work
