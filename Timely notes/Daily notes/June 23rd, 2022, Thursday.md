### [[Evening Review]]

#### [[Journal]]

Today was a productive day. I started the day with the new build system kind of working, and ended the day with a result that I could be really proud of. I shared it in the React guild meeting and all of my teammates were really impressed with the results. The were impressed with the speed of starting the server/building the app, the fact that we can run any part of our app with one command, and the simplicity of the set up. I was really happy to be able to share it. We also deployed the release I made with the MUI5 upgrade, as well as some fixes for messages. I was really happy to see those go out too. [[Josie Wittwer]] sent me a message on Slack congratulating me on the release and expressed her reaction to the build updates with a head exploding emoji. So that's really good. We went to Half Price  Books with [[Natasha Anderson]] and [[Alex Anderson]] and then went over to their house for dinner. i think we were with them for like 4 and a half hours. We had a lot of really good conversations.
