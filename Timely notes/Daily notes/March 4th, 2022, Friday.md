#### [[Journal]]

Today was quite the day. Taylor opened at Caribou so we were up at 4am. I wasted away most of the morning and started work around 10. I got a little ways into the 3 column layout and that was about it. I had a couple of meetings and we moved the first release for murmur into preprod, and the fast follows into the murmur env. We are having Bella and Makenna stay the night tonight and a little part of me is regretting it. It gets to be much less fun the older they are. I'm glad that our kid won't just come out like they are and we get the chance to grow with our kid
