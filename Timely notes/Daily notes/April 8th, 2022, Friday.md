### [[Morning Routine]]

#### Prompts

##### [[What Would Make Today awesome?]]

The thing that made today awesome already happened. I love being able to get together with family and having breakfast with [[Alexandre St-Pierre]], [[Arianne Richards]], and [[Makenna Richards]] was awesome

##### [[How Can I Live in Alignment with My Values and Beliefs in Life today?]]

Prioritizing my family and healthy work life balance. It is easy to let that go when you are trying to get stuff done before PTO, but it is still really important

##### [[What Gives Me the Most Energy at work?]]

Having a deadline that I am aiming for. I always get the most done when I am pushing to accomplish something in a set timeframe

### [[Evening Review]]

#### [[Journal]]

This morning I drove Taylor to work so that I could take [[Alexandre St-Pierre]] to the airport. Before I took him there we got breakfast with [[Arianne Richards]] and [[Makenna Richards]]. It was really fun, and Makenna did really good. I was sad to see Alexandre leave. I was also glad to have some of my normal life back too. Loved getting to see him, but having someone staying with you is just a constant pressure and presence that feels unsettling. Like just trying to cook dinner or relax and feeling like you have to entertain or take care of someone. I am also glad to be able to work in my office again, even though it is only for one day because on Sunday we go to Malibu!!! There was a pretty big bug in the messages release we put out yesterday. I had an optional chaining for the recipients from the search messages endpoint, but then checking the length of it afterwards. I needed to make sure that I actually had an array to check the length of. So I had to change it to a ternary operator that would set the value to an empty array if the recipient array wasn't present. Easy fix, but it was completely breaking things when there was a sent message in the search results. They had to do an emergency release. Thankfully [[Eric Peters]] was around to release the code, I just had to find the fix. 

After the bug was solved Taylor and I went to Target to get me jeans and shorts for the trip! I am pretty excited about them. We also went to Chipotle, but the food we got was incredibly mediocre.
