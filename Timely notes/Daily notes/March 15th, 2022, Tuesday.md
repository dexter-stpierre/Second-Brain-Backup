### Prompts

### [[What Made You Particularly Proud or grateful?]]

I am proud of how I figured out how to make the legacy modal work today. It seemed like it wasn't going to come together, but it did in the end. I just had to figure out what pieces I needed to pull in to make it all work.

### [[Did Today matter?]]

I think so. I got a good workout in and every day that I get one of those in matters. I also got a lot done at work. I don't feel like my evening particularly mattered. I feel like I wasn't present in what I was doing and I wasn't a great husband. Taylor blamed it on my hard day at work, but I'm not so sure.

### [[What Interesting Ideas Did I Come across?]]

Somebody in the Readwise discord shared a podcast that the host goes into some philosophy basics. Those could be interesting to listen to

#### [[Journal]]

This morning I pushed myself and did a 1.25 mile run. It felt really good to go that far. Today at work I worked frantically on the select all and admin preview. I felt disorganized and behind schedule all day. The admin preview was much more difficult than I thought it would be. This afternoon Taylor and I took Betty on our first walk around Lake Como for the spring. It was a little wet, but that's okay. Taylor said that it seemed like I wasn't very invested in anything that we did today. I think I agree with her. I think that almost everything that we did there was something else that I would rather be doing.
