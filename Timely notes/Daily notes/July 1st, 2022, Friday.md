#### [[Journal]]

Today was a sucky day of work. We had a release that was supposed to go out that got delayed because of some updates that Erin made to the sharedComponentLibrary, and the changes she made were very obviously going to impact other parts of the application. I think people are going to get too focused on the fact of when it was merged into staging as opposed to how to actually prevent similar things in the future. One thing I wish that MUI allowed us to do is to distinguish between 2 different themes. Unfortunately it just uses whatever is the closest theme, so that doesn't really work to have a different theme used by the sharedComponentLibrary. The alternative of course is that we will have to override the inputs on a few different elements. Which I think we can just pass in a component, so we could totally use on of our shared components. And if we can't we should be able to export the styles and at least reuse those
