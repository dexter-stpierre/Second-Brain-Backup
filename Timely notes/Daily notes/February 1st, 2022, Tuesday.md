### [[Evening Review]]

#### [[Journal]]

This morning I got up and went to the gym and had a short, but good climb. It was nice to get a good workout in. I made eggs and potatoes for breakfast. Taylor got breakfast with Quincy. I was super productive at work today. Knocked out half of Luke's punchlist, got a good chunk on message archive done, and had several meeting. I am rarely this productive, especially on days with a bunch of meetings.

Taylor's friend Molly asked if we wanted free tickets to the Timberwolves game, and of course the answer is always yes. We went for a quick baby date at Chipotle, and then went to the game. The seats were way better than I had sat in at Timberwolves games before. They were row D on the lower floor, super cool.
