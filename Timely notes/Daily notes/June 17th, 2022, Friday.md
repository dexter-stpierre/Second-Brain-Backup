Today I took the day off to just have a chill day to relax. I woke up with Taylor, then took a nap after she left. I went for a bike ride, and then took a bath. After that I played Halo for a little bit and ate lunch. After lunch I read for a couple hours and then Taylor got home. Tonight we went to Back to the 50s at the State Fair Grounds. It was really fun, and they had so much of my favorite fair food. I was able to get the duck bacon wontons and the poutine.
