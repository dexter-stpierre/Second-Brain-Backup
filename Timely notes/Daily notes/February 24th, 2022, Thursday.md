Today Russia invaded Ukraine. I saw reports that it had started last night, but I didn't imagine it would go as quickly as it did. I think it is easy to underestimate just how quickly a war can take hold. Russia has bombed most of their major cities, have taken over Chernobyl, and have announced that they will continue to bomb Kyiv. I'm honestly scared. This could turn out to be the start of another world war. A madman on the loose with unprecedented power, determine to destroy anyone who resists him. Except this time the madman controls the largest stockpile of nukes. I don't know how to even handle that fact. I worried that this conflict will hit us here at home. And a part of me is scared that our country will sit back and do nothing. War is evil and I don't understand how a human gets to the point where they could decide to start one for no reason. I don't understand how people with that sick of brains can get into power. But they do. And we celebrate them.

I didn't get anything done at work today. I was way too focused in on what is happening in Ukraine. We watched Grey's Anatomy and Station 19, and we ordered food from Uber Eats for dinner. I texted with Jack a little bit and asked him about his depression. We are gonna hangout this weekend.
