I finally finished the stuff for Sonarqube. It feels really good to have it ready to go. I was able to get on a bike ride this morning and it was really nice to do it. I had just enough time to do one lap around Lake Como. I am planning to do 2 or 3 laps tomorrow. Carol messaged Taylor that she could come to the cabin on Saturday after testing negative for covid. We are hoping that if I test negative tomorrow that she will say that I can come too. And hopefully we'll just be able to come for the whole weekend. Jack said he can't come to the movie tomorrow, so Taylor might come instead
