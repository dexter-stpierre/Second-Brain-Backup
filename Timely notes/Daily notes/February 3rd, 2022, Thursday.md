Today I woke up and went to the gym again, I really hard a hard time doing anything. I only made it like 2 minutes on the stair climber, and then I walked half a mile on the treadmill at 3 mph. It was exhausting

Work today was busy. I didn't get a ton of work done because I was fielding questions the whole time. And I had a lot of meetings. I shared my usePersistentState hook in the front end guild and the team liked it. And then I shared about what JSDocs are and how they can be useful to our team. Everyone seemed to get really excited about them

I had my yearly review with Josie and it went really well. All the feedback was sating that I was doing a really great job, and should keep doing more of what I am doing. Once I get access to my final review doc I will import it into here and spend some time thinking about it and deciding how I want to move forward with it.

We are staying at the Ewings house while Heath and Ginger take Daniel to Texas for a college tour. It should be a good time, these kids are always super easy to watch. I'm excited to have the house to myself while all of the kids are at school. I went to go watch Xavier Ripplinger at his High School wrestling match, but apparently the website had the wrong time so I missed it. I am planning to go to his meet on Wednesday. It is one of his last meets of his senior year.
