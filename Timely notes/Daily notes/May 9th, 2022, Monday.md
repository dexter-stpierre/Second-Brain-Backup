##### [[What Was Something That I Did for Someone Else today?]]

I took time to work through an issue with Erin and Kate

#### [[Journal]]

What a day. This morning I went to Caribou to do my weekly review and planning and finished all the sections. I don't do that very often so it felt good to do it today. I worked, and wasn't _super_ productive, but that's okay. Taylor hadn't felt the baby move since Saturday, so she was really worried that something was wrong with him. Thankfully he ended up being fine. Tonight we went on a walk, I made burgers, and Taylor hugout with [[Quincy O'Brien]]
