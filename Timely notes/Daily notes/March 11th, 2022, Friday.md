#### [[Journal]]

This morning I went to the gym and ran a mile and climbed. It was really nice to do both. I had time, even though I slept in a little later than I normally do on gym days. Taylor went and got us Caribou. I got a lot done today, almost finishing the paginated message list. I was super close, just a last few things to figure out on Monday. Then I need to take care of select all and the admin preview and then I will be done with messages. Tonight Taylor and I had pulled pork for dinner and played some games
