I don't think my day went to crap. It was a fine day

#### [[Journal]]

Today was a good day. Woke up a little early and spent time looking for a primary Dr. I found someone who look promising, but when I called the clinic I ended up just going with whoever had openings. I also scheduled a dentist appointment, and took care of a couple of other things on my todo list, so that was good. Felt very productive. I also got some decent stuff done at work. I spent some time trying to figure out how to handle showing the links in a message as clickable, without rendering all html elements in the message. I found something that I think will work. Tonight I did code coaching for Prime. It was good. Avery needed some help conceptualizing joins in SQL, Miley needed help understanding the feedback she got from Dane, and Nate had some Redux Sagas stuff he needed help on. I had never worked with Sagas before, so it was interesting to see what it looked like.
