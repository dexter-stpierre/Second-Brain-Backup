### [[Evening Review]]

#### Prompts

##### [[Did I do something that was out my comfort zone?]]

I'm not sure that I did anything out of my comfort zone today. I guess maybe a small thing outside of my comfort zone was showing Taylor the before and afters of the baby room

#### [[Journal]]

Today was a pretty simple Sunday, which I feel like I needed. We slept in and then went to Brueggers for breakfast. Then we went grocery shopping. After that we hungout and played some Sequence. I organized the basement a little bit and then we went for a walk. I made us a new thing for dinner, it was just okay. We watched some episodes of Good Girls and now we are heading to bed. I am really looking forward to my weekly review/planning session tomorrow. I am excited to have some time to just focus on myself and my goals
