This morning I went to Caribou and did my weekly planning/review. It went pretty well. At work I was mostly focused on fixing a specific bug in the journals release. It was a weird bug, and I don't understand why it was happening the way that it was, but the code is a little complicated to work through, so I'm just gonna trust this fix, considering it was simply restoring the exact logic that was present before, just with the initialization if needed. I got the shelfs up in the baby room and I think that they really add a great touch with the little toys from Bill on there.
