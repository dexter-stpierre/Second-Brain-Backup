### [[Evening Review]]

#### [[Journal]]

Today I got up and went to Caribou to do my weekly review/plan. I think today was the first time I have completed the whole thing (even if some of it was right before bed). It was good, I really like having this habit. I think it is a very healthy thing for me. 

At work today I nailed the 3 column layout. It took some hard, focused, work. But I finished it. I talk with Matt a little bit about it and he was pretty impressed with how good it was. He is happy to get to use it on expenses. There was a couple of designs that I referenced to try and make sure that it was all set up as well as possible. I am proud of what I ended up with. I think there will be some changes that need to happen for various situations down the line, but I think we will deal with that when we get there.

Tonight Taylor and I went grocery shopping. Then we got the groceries put away and I cooked dinner. During and after dinner we watched Schitts Creek for a while and then I did a massive mountain of dishes. Now we are off to bed.
