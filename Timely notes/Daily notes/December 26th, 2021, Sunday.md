Today was a good day. Taylor and I slept in the living room again. We woke up around 8 and ate a small breakfast, and went grocery shopping. We bought a lot different foods than normal to try and have lots of healthy stuff for Taylor and the baby. [[Terry Giller]] came over for lunch and the Vikings game and we got to tell her that we are having a baby. We was overjoyed. It was so sweet to see how excited she was. And we also go to tell [[Mom]], [[Dad]], and [[Alexandre St-Pierre]] tonight and they were so happy too. I was glad that they were so excited because this will be their 6th grand kid, I thought that they wouldn't think it was that special. But they were so excited. I think we will be able to tell [[Rosendo St Pierre]] and [[Arianne Richards]] this weekend. I am really looking forward to getting to tell them.
