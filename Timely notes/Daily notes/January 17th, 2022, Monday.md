Today was a good day. Taylor worked at 6am. I intended to get my weekly review/plan done this morning, but I decided to take it easy and play ESO instead. I am okay with this decision. I will get some kind of weekly review/plan done tomorrow. For lunch we made some homemade pizzas. Those are always fun. They did not agree with Taylor's stomach though. We took Betty for a walk since it was so nice.  Taylor hungout with one of her new friends and I sat around the house and played some ESO and started watching Archive 81. It seems like a really good show. And then tonight we watched the Rams-Cardinals game and the Rams CRUSHED. I also made pulled pork for Taylor's lunches this week. It was my first time making it and we both think it turned out great!
