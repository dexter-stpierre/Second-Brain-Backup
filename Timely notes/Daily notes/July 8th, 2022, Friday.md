Today I figured out how to fix the issue with prod logrocket sessions ending up in the non prod instance. It is as simple as using the host to determine if the app is running in prod, and change the default based on that. Really easy honestly. We went to Express and Kohls to do some returns this afternoon, and I went to Menards to get some stuff for the projects I am doing tomorrow. We went for a walk after dinner

#### Notable News

- Elon musk is trying to get out of buying Twitter. Twitter won't let him out easy
