##### [[How Did I Make Others feel?]]

Today I reached out to Matt and told him that I was happy that he's back. I imagine that it made him feel a little bit good to receive a message like that

#### [[Journal]]

This morning I went for my first run around the neighborhood. It felt really nice. Being outside is great, and it was just a little chilly when I started which helped it to not be unbearable. I got some good work done on some messages tasks, which was really good. Made some good progress, and should be able to continue making more. I'm glad that making the button to search in all messages if a search came up empty was so easy. Since I was clearing things like selected messages and searchToken in the handler when navigating all I had to do was add a link that didn't call that handler. And I shouldn't have to worry about clearing selected messages since it wouldn't be possible for there to be any. This is one situation where not having a state machine might be beneficial. Because if I handled effects during state transitions then I would have to make a work around to be able to transition to a new folder without clearing the search token. Taylor took the car to Midas to be worked on and they said that we need a part replaced to be able to replace the serpentine belt. They said that the repair will come out to $900. I'm honestly feeling a little bit stressed about money. Taylor's mom is in the hospital again and when Taylor was FaceTiming her she really didn't look good. I think Taylor is really worried about her and I'm not really sure how to support her. I feel like a crappy husband because all I can say is "I'm sorry", but I can't really do anything. I am starting to wonder if Taylor should fly out there to see her. Taylor's dad called her yesterday to tell her that she is going to be an amazing mom and it was honestly so sweet.
