I totally forgot to get up and do my weekly planning/review, so I'll have to get up early enough to do that tomorrow. Today was the 4th of July so I had the day off. Taylor and I slept in until around 10, which felt pretty nice. We mostly just hung out around the house, which was nice. Taylor was feeling pretty motivated and I just wasn't on that level, which made the day feel pretty frustrating for me. Taylor wanted to get all of the stuff from the baby shower organized, which she did while I just chilled in the glider. Then she wanted me to organize the built in while she organized the baby stuff that we already had. Then she wanted to do some cleaning downstairs. I wasn't feeling on that level. After lunch she wanted to go on a walk. After dinner we thankfully chilled a little more. Having a dog honestly makes me hate the 4th, and the 4th kind of makes me hate having a dog. Betty is on 2 of her meds and is honestly still kind of freaking out. Next year I might have to give her 3. Which I know that Taylor won't like because she really hates when we have to give Betty her meds. But it is one of those things where we either feel bad for the meds, or feel bad about her having super bad anxiety because of the fireworks. And I would rather feel bad about the meds. So yeah, I think I'll just have to make the choice next time and just give her the meds.
