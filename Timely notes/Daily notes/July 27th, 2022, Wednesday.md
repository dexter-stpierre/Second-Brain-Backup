This morning I woke up a little bit early and read for a little bit, then I made myself some avocado toast. I started the morning by chatting with Erin and fixing her ofw-web-common issue, and then I looked into an issue with some styling and passed the fix over to Chad. Today I finished up my fix for the styles with Vite, and deployed them to murmur. I am gonna share a little bit about them with the team tomorrow. Tonight we went to Tommy and Denna's for dinner, and they weren't even there. But Taylor's grandma was. Which was quite the surprise. The dinner wasn't even as bad as we thought it would be when they were gonna be there, so that's good. We went for a walk after dinner
