### [[Morning Routine]]

I woke up feeling very tired, but I managed to only hit snooze once. I didn't do anything productive with my morning time, which I feel fairly okay about honestly. I am just proud of myself for getting up the earliest I have in a while

### [[Evening Review]]

#### [[Journal]]

First day back at work. I got nothing done. Wasted time until lunch, ate, then wasted time until sprint planning, then wasted time until 3. Tomorrow I need to start with more of a plan. I will immediately start working on the search stuff tomorrow to have something easy to knock off. I think I could handle the entire thing in like 2 hours. Then I will get the React stuff deployed to the murmur env. 

Moving on from work, Taylor and I went for a dinner and movie date to look at what is going on with the baby this week. This was for sure the highlight of my day. I really enjoyed getting to spend time with her. I missed her today. We watched Sing 2, which was pretty good. A decent first movie of the year. I did the math and I went to see a movie at least 14 times last year, all after May. That's a lot of movies.
