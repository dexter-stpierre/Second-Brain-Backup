### [[Evening Review]]

#### [[Journal]]

This morning I woke up early and went to the gym. I ran a mile and did a little arm workout. It felt good to get a good workout in to start the day. This morning we release the first release of the message rewrite, and there were no major issues. There were a couple of small things that will be taken care of in the fast follows. For dinner Taylor and I went to Texas Roadhouse. It was my first time there and it was so good. I got a smothered sirloin with mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. The mashed potatoes were great, the mac and cheese was just okay. Then I spent around 2.5 hours grading assignments for Prime
