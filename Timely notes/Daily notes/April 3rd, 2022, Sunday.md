This morning Taylor and I went and picked up a glider from Facebook marketplace. The couple we picked it up from were seriously SO nice and we wanted to be best friends with them. We went to Rosey and Mara's house to all get together as a family and so Alexandre could see all of them that live up there. On the way home we tried to get Chipotle for dinner, but the one that Taylor likes the most was closed and the other one was online order only. Taylor didn't want to risk the other one being closed so we went to Noodles and Company instead. After dinner I ended up playing Elden Ring for a little while and then Taylor and I watched TikToks
