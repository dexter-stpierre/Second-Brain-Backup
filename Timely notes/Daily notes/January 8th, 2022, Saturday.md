Today was a good day. Taylor and I went to Caribou for coffee and breakfast and it was really nice to just sit and talk about life, and things that have been going on lately. I got lunch with Nathan Krawza today at Pizza Luce. It was good food and good conversations. We talked about what it is like to transition from being college aged to being a real young adult. I'm proud of that kid, he has come a long way from when I first met him. After lunch Taylor and I watched some tiktocks and then sent to the gym. The gym was fun, and no where near as busy as it was when I went earlier this week. Then I cooked dinner, and we played some games. Then I read while she watched a show and now we are heading to bed.
