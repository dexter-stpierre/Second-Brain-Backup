#### [[Journal]]

Today was a day. I got really frustrated with my coworkers today. There was a lot of "AHA THERE'S AN ISSUE" without reliable reproductions, or explanations of what was happening. I repeatedly asked for more information and received nothing to work off of. QA was seeing automated tests failing, and all they were saying was that they had to update tests that they updated last week. No mention of what tests, what part was failing, or what they expected. The code was the same as in prod and there was no mention of if the tests were passing in prod. The only thing that Ryan said that provided any info was that they XPath for the date picker in parent schedule had changed. No information on what they were trying to use as a path, what they had to change it to, why it had been changed before, anything like that. I asked multiple times for more information and I don't think my messages were ever acknowledged. Other devs who aren't front end devs were getting responded to, but I felt like I was screaming into a void. It was a very frustrating experience and made me feel like shit. I think this was the most frustrating experience I have had at OFW.
