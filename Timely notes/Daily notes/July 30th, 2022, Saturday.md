Today was a good day. We went to the farmers market and got some potatoes, carrots, and bison steaks, then we went to Trader Joe's and got a few things there. I texted with Rosey today for a little bit. He is trying to get a new job, so I sent him some postings for some sales roles, and told him that I think he would be a really good project manager. So I think we are gonna facetime sometime soon so I can tell him about what a role in that would look like. We went over to Natasha and Alex's house tonight and I got to meet Rory. She is so stinking cute and tiny. We were there for like 4 hours, it was really fun
