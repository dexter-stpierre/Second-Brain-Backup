Today was my birthday. I started the day by digging through some weird commits to try and untangle a mess that Chad had made in his merge. A bunch of files had been moved around or deleted, and it made it really hard to determine how to fix it. Took me about an hour to work through all the issues and make sure that everything worked. I think it would be valuable to merge in things that are slated to be released 9 days before the release. Of course we can continue to do work on them, but they would at least be together. But then I guess things would get really fucked if something ends up having to be pulled from the release. People would be having to cherry-pick commits, and sort all of the mess out.

We had an appointment for the baby today and he had a good heartbeat. He is growing at about the right rate, and everything looks good. That was good to hear. Next week we'll get to do our last ultrasound. For lunch we got Panera and for dinner we went to Kyotos and had Sushi. Josh, Marie, Alex, and Nat all came out, so that was really nice.
