Today was a good day. Slept in until around 9 and then got Caribou, and Taylor wanted to go to Target and Ulta. After that we had lunch, and then brought Terry some cough syrup. She isn't doing well and Taylor thinks she will have to go to the hospital again. I honestly didn't handle that whole situations well at all. I kind of just ignored it and I know that isn't the right way to handle it. I want to do a better job supporting her but sometimes I just don't know what is the best way to do it. 

We hung out with Nat and Ginge tonight. Went to Red Cow and then went to their house. I always enjoy hanging out with them, their good people.
