I'm feeling pretty down today. I'm not really sure why. I had the day off, I hungout with Alexandre, went to the happy hour, worked out. It was a good day filled with good things, but I am still just feeling sad. I think it might actually be because I spent so much time looking at all the issues that people had with the messages release. I think I just need to trust the people who's job it is to compile the feedback and decide how to advance. Sure a handful of people are upset about it, but many thousands of people have been using it without issues. And I think that is a huge win and the more important thing to focus on. Most of the people's complaints will be handled as part of future projects, and we knew that some of them might cause issues. I just need to keep moving forward and keep working on what I know will make our product better.

Tonight Alexandre and I went to the [[OFW]] happy hour. It was so much fun! It was really great to get to meet people and actually have conversations with them face to face. I really enjoyed getting to connect with Guillaume, Matt, and Iain. They were the ones that I talked with them most
