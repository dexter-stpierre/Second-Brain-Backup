Today was a fun day. We went to Starbucks with Nat and Ginge and then we went to Once Upon A Child for a sale they were having, and then to Half Price Books just because it was there. Then we went to Original Pancake House, just because it was right there. After that we went home and cleaned a little bit. Taylor took a nap and I read for a little bit. Quincy came over and we watched Encanto. It was actually a pretty good movie, I liked it
