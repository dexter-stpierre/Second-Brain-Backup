##### [[What Needs To Happen For Today To Be A Success?]]

The baby appointment needs to go well. I know that it is out of my control, but if it doesn't go well then nothing else can make today a good day

##### [[What Was the Most Important Thing I Did today?]]

The most important thing I did today was making sure that Taylor knew that her and the baby were much more important than the movie I was going to. I imagine that I really showed her that I love her with how I responded to being late to the movie

#### [[Journal]]

The world feels really hectic lately. I think a lot of things that we took for granted no longer feel guaranteed. [[Roe v Wade]] might be getting overturned and I think it is really showing how fragile all this stuff is. Everything that feels so real and concrete is showing just how weak and brittle it is. All institutions are just smoke and mirrors. The government isn't anything concrete. The [[Constitution]] is just a piece of paper that means nothing if the things that it guarantees aren't protected. Things that feel real, are just ideas that we hold to really tightly. I don't understand why all these things are held in such high importance. This doesn't feel like how we are meant to live.

Anyways, just gonna move on from that existential crisis. This morning I went to the gym and did a short run followed by some climbing. Tomorrow I think I will get my bike set up so that I can ride it this summer. I think I'll try to do that before work. Work today was fine. I had a 1:1 with Josie and it went okay. She said that she would like me to own a project end to end and that would go a long way towards me becoming a senior dev. I think the project is the shared component library, which Erin has really owned, and I think she is doing a good job of. This afternoon I hopped on a call with [[Erin Black]] and [[Kate Pementer]] to help them debug a useEffect call that was stuck in an endless loop. They were updating a state variable that the useEffect was dependent on. They were updating it inside of an API call's .then handler and they were using the variable declared when creating the useState hook. So they were encountering stale renders

This afternoon we went to a baby appointment. It was really fun because they took a recording of the baby's heartbeat and put it in a little stuffed animal. It was really cute. They I went to see Doctor Strange In the Multiverse of Madness. I really enjoyed the movie. John Krasinski played Mr Fantastic in it, which was really exciting

During work I started listening to a talk from a guy talking about how to remove useEffect from your code. It was an interesting idea, and if you are using state machines then I think it is doable for sure. But I'm not sure that it is an argument for state machines all on it's own. I think there are ways to minimize useEffect hooks without going through all that trouble
