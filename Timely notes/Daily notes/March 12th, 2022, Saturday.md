### [[Evening Review]]

#### [[Journal]]

Today was [[Natasha Anderson]] and [[Alex Anderson]]'s baby gender reveal, and they are having a girl! We are very excited for them because that is what they wanted! It was a ton of fun to hang out with them and their people. I haven't really spent any time with either of their families, so that was interesting. We went to [[Arianne Richards]] and [[Jesse Richards]]' house for dinner tonight. We hadn't been over there to hang out with them in forever and it was really nice to just sit around and chat for hours! Super glad we did it!
