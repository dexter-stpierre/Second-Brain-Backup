Wow wow wow I am SORE today. Yesterday's ultimate game really messed me up. I am looking forward to getting a good nights sleep, hopefully that helps my sore legs. I sure hope so because I am planning on going for a run tomorrow morning. Today was a pretty lazy day. Did the bare minimum for work, and skipped a workout due to being sore. I made a new steak recipe for dinner and it was pretty good.
