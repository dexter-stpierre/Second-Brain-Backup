Today was another day of getting basically nothing done at work. I had 0 motivation and a headache basically all day. I just wanna coast up to my parental leave, but I know that it isn't right to do. Tonight we had the Richards over for dinner and I made barbecue chicken, brats, burgers, and potatoes. It was all good. Then Taylor and I went to see Matilda the Musical, which was pretty fun. The cast did really well.
