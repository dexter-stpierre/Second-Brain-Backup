#### Prompts

##### [[Did I Do Something That Was Out My Comfort zone?]]

Honestly I am not really good at doing things that are outside of my comfort zone. I don't even know if I have many opportunities to do something like that.

#### [[Journal]]

Today was an interesting day. I got a decent amount of stuff done, but at the same time I was very lazy. I think some things just took less time than I expected, so I got a lot of stuff done with very little effort. Which was nice. We went to [[Marissa Nisius]] and [[Andrew Nisius]] house for dinner and [[Josh Pope]] and [[Marie Bennis]] were there too. It was fun, we ate and just chatted for a few hours.
