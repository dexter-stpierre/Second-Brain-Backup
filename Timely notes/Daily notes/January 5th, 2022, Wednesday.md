Today we had Tim come and look at the heat. I thought it would be just draining and bleeding the pipes, but it turns out that the bladder on the system is shot and needs to be replaced. So he will be coming back on Friday to do that. It's gonna cost $900, so that stinks. But I am glad that we have enough in savings that it doesn't feel stressful to pull that out. Work was okay today. I got a little bit done, but still not much. Tomorrow morning I want to start the day on time and focused.
