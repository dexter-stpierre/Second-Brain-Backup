This morning I went to the gym and did a climbing workout. It felt nice to get a really good workout in. I got a little bit of an early start to the workday because I had a lot to get done today and only a half day of actual work to do it in. I got a good amount of work done (like 6 tickets completed). It is enough to be proud of for only a half day. We had our big yearly kickoff meeting for work today. It was cool to hear about where we are as a company and where the company is heading. They talked quite a bit about the new office space, which seems pretty cool. I think I might try to go in once or twice a week once I'm back at work after the baby is here. Tonight we went to get the flooring for the baby's room so I can get started on it when Taylor is in Texas this weekend
