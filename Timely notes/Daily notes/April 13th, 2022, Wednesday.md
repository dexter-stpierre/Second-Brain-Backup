### [[Evening Review]]

#### Prompts

##### [[What has happened on this day that happened on no previous day?]]

Today Taylor and I got to have dinner at a nice restaurant on the beach. That is a first for us

##### [[What did I discover new about myself?]]

I find myself really wanting to live in a place where we can have a lot of variety to our lives. I find that living in Minnesota makes a lot of the days the same, but living in a place with a greater variety of landscapes would bring a lot of variety to life.

#### [[Journal]]

Today was a really fun day. We had Tacos Por Favor for lunch again today and it was SO good. Taylor and I spent time sitting and reading, and then went for a walk, on Billionaire's Beach. It was really nice, and it was fun to see all the super nice houses. After the beach we went to try and find some playing cards, but didn't have any luck. But we did get some delicious chocolate hazelnut filled donuts that were SO good. They are apparently imported from France or something. I think we are planning to go back again tomorrow, and they have this thin long sandwich that looks so good that I am going to try. For dinner we went down to Paradise Cove, which is a restaurant on a private beach that you can eat out on the sand. It was so good. We were pretty nervous about the birds attacking us like they did on out honeymoon. They didn't, but the moment that people left their tables the birds would hop right up. After dinner we came back up to the Airbnb and hungout. I played a little bit of Dark Souls and I took a bath
