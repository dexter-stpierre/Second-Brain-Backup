#### [[Journal]]

Today was Betty's birthday!! This morning we took her with us to get Caribou and get her a pup cup. After lunch we went to the Battle Creek dog park and took a good long walk around there. After that we set up the new spice rack we got and then I went grocery shopping for the week. We had burgers and fries and I read some of [[Last Arguments of Kings]]. It was a pretty good day.
