We flew back from Malibu overnight. I was so sad to be leaving because the trip was SO fun. But I am also really looking forward to getting back into a routine. Life has been so hectic for weeks now, and I am ready to be back to normal life. I didn't fall asleep on the flight home at all. I maybe should have read instead of playing games, might have helped me fall asleep better. When we got home we took a quick nap and then went to Easter egg coloring at Sheila's house. After that we picked up Betty and she was SO excited to see us again. We came back home for nap round 2, then Taylor got dinner with [[Sabrina Stevens]] and I stayed home and ate sushi, watched [[Marvel/Moon Knight]] and played [[Elden Ring]]. It was a pretty good day. I am very ready to sleep tonight
