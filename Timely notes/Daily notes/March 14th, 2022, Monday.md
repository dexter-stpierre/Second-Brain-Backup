### [[Did I Treat Myself Well, Respecting My Limits and My margins?]]

I stated the timing that I can realistically get the messages fast follows finished. I also decided to not handle the direct links to messages for the time being. That was going to keep me stuck on one issue for longer than it deserves. Especially if we move back to infinite scroll when advanced search/filter/sort gets released.

#### [[Journal]]

This morning I went to Caribou and did a weekly review. I finished the whole thing, which I think is a first. Felt good to get that much done. At work today I finished setting up the paginated messages, and got most of the way finished with select all. All I have left for that is to fix the styling of the checkbox. Should be pretty easy to do. Then it is just the admin preview to finish. I also want to do the optimizing of the ToastContext, which should be pretty easy to implement. After work today I went to the eye doctor and had my eyes checked. They said I need bifocals, which feels so weird. But I do know that my eyes are in a bad spot. The doctor said I will likely get really bad headaches when I get my new prescription, which I am a little worried about. I just remember how bad of headaches when I first got my glasses and I am not looking forward to that again. I am excited for the frames that we picked out though. I think I look super good in them. Today is Pi Day so we of course got french silk pie from Perkins
