I got a lot of the MUI5 migration done today. It was a lot of work, but I am so close. I just have to figure out what is going on with the holidays page. For some reason almost none of the styling on the form is working locally. That is the only place where I can find an issue though. I think I also have to migrate all of the withStyles calls too. I am thinking about writing a wrapper for the new withStyles api to make the migration easier. I might need to do that for Holidays because Holidays has some withStyles calls that I think is fucking things up. It's worth looking into at least. Tonight we did a call with [[Sabrina Stevens]] where she asked us some questions about marriage for a paper she has to write for one of her classes
