#### Prompts

##### [[What can I do better tomorrow?]]

I have already set myself up to do better tomorrow. Reactivated my time limit for social media, blocked/unblocked apps that i either need, or don't need. Added in downtime for all days. Ensured that apps that waste my time don't show up in the top level in my app library, or in Siri suggestions. I think those changes should be pretty helpful for me.

#### [[Journal]]

This morning we drove all the way out to Golden Valley to pick up a bookshelf from Facebook Marketplace, but the person didn't respond to Taylor's messages. So we left from there and went down to watch [[Isabella Richards]]' volleyball game. The game overall was really rough with that young of kids, but she had a couple of pretty good serves! I think she could greatly improve by learning the proper way to bump the ball. She is don't the way that makes the ball hit your bones, and I can tell that it really hurts. After the game we went and got the bookshelf and a mirror. We ate Canes for lunch and then Taylor went over to Sophia's house to hangout for the afternoon. While she was gone I played Halo for a while and then read [[Atomic Habits]] for a little bit. I actually did pretty good in Halo. When Taylor got home we went for a walk and then I made dinner. After dinner we watched a couple of episodes of Good Girls and then I read for a little bit. Now it's time for bed
