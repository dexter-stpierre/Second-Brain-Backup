I'm feeling too tired to write much. Today was Taylor's first day back to work, and my last day of winter break. I am honestly dreading going back to work. I don't feel rested and rejuvenated. Tonight I feel drained. There was a loud noise that sounded like it was coming from the basement, and if it was it could have been our boiler having an issue. Which would really suck. I tried making a chicken broth today and it wasn't good. Didn't turn out anything like what other people say theirs does. I made a chili, which turned out fine, but took forever. I went to the gym and it was way overcrowded. Just feels like there was a lot working against me today.
