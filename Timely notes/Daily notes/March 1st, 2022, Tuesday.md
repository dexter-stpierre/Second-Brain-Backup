This morning Taylor drove her friend Maddy to the airport. I slept in until 7:30. There was not chance of me getting up early. Tomorrow I will go to the gym though. I called the mortgage company to confirm that our new insurance was paid for and that I should put the check we got from the old insurance into our escrow account. The answer to both of those was yes. I got a little bit done at work today. I worked through the icon indicator with Erin for a little bit, just to see if she thought adding it to the base icon made sense. She thought it did. We went on a long walk in the neighborhood and then we had Chipotle for dinner. I got a little bit of grading done for Prime
