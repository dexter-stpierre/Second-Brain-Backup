### [[Evening Review]]

#### Prompts

##### [[Did I do something that was out my comfort zone?]]

I really pushed for Avery to take some time to rest, and I don't know if I have really had to push someone for that before

#### [[Journal]]

This morning I went for a bike ride even though I played ultimate last night. I'm glad that I did it, but my legs are really sore now.I think I'm gonna go and climb at the gym tomorrow. I made some good progress on Vite today, but I had a bug come up for the release so I had to switch gears and I haven't had a chance to finish. I'm gonna try to be really zero'd in tomorrow so that I can finish that up for our guild meeting tomorrow. Taylor and I went to Midway books and I got two volumes on Knightfall, a Batman storyline. I'm not sure if it is only two volumes, or if there are others. We had Arbys for dinner. I had the second week of code coaching for Prime and it went well! A couple of people showed up who didn't come last week and there were some really good questions. I was a little worried about Avery because he was showing some obvious signs of burnout so I told him to take some time to rest, and told his instructor about what I noticed so that she can keep an eye out for him
