Today was the day that Taylor went up to the Cabin. I stayed home since I guess I was still too close to having Covid. I basically just played Pokemon Shining Pearl all day. I also got the new pantry cabinet put together and got all of the food organized. Getting the food organized took much longer than I expected, and the cabinet filled up much quicker than I thought it would. When Taylor got home she told me all the stories from the cabin. Her dad's neighbor that he was really close with came up, and he hadn't seen him in like 35 years. So that was really special. Mary Anne and Jeff got married. I had no idea that they weren't married, so not much changed in that regard. And John had a lot of really sweet things to say on the car rides.
