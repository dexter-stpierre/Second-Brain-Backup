I was not as productive at work as I wanted to be, for the second day in a row. I need to figure out how to get out of this huge rut I'm in. I am hoping that being in a coffee shop and just completely out of my normal environment will be beneficial for me. I am going to try to really focus on a small task when I first start working to make sure that I can accomplish something quickly.

Tomorrow is out first appointment for the baby. Assuming that the baby is healthy we will get to hear the heartbeat and see the baby in an ultrasound. I am SO excited, but also pretty nervous because I don't know how either of us would be able to handle bad news.
