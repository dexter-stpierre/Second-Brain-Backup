### Prompts

### [[How Am I Making a Difference in This world?]]

I'm building an app that makes communications for separated families easier, and I am working to make the use of that better. All while making it a better app to work on and improving the experience of my fellow developers

### [[What Can I Do to Show Appreciation for a Coworker or Friend today?]]

I think I will send Erin a message telling her how good she did on the demo yesterday

### [[What Do I Want to Be True in 12 months’ Time That isn’t True today?]]

I want to say that I have been prioritizing learning about things that interest me. Not just work stuff, but other topics too

### [[Evening Review]]

#### [[Journal]]

This morning I went to the gym and just spent time climbing. It was nice to be in a spot where my hand could handle that again. I really enjoyed it. Today I finished up abstracting the NavItem so that it could be reused. I had a couple of meetings and fielded some questions from QA. Tomorrow I should be able to knock out switching the message list to use pagination, and I think I should be able to get most of the way through the select all as well. Looking forward to a productive day

Tonight [[Taylor St Pierre|Taylor]], [[Jack Carlson]], and I went to see [[Waitress]] at the [[Ordway Theater]]. It was so good! It was really cool to have the pieces of the story that I was missing due to only listening to the soundtrack filled in. Taylor and Jack seemed like they really liked it too. I am really glad that we went, it was worth the money. I hope that we can go to more musicals.
