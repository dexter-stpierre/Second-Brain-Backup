Today we had originally planned to go to a few stores, but we decided to hold that off until tomorrow since it was freezing cold all day today. Taylor and I had sex today, and afterwards Taylor was bleeding, which was pretty scary. From what we could find on the internet, and it was confirmed by one of Taylor's friends, it is pretty normal to bleed after sex while pregnant. Taylor said that it was below the amount that they say is concerning, but it is still pretty nerve wrecking. It kind of makes me not want to have sex until we have our first appointment, especially with how much it affected Taylor. Taylor got lunch with Molly Reagan and drove her friend Maddy to the Airport. During each of those times I spent time brainstorming goals that I want to set for next year. I want these goals to be things that encourage me, and not to be goals that I need to catch up on if I fall behind. I want them to be processes, not outcomes. That way I will be encouraged to pick up on them if I fall off. When Taylor has Miranda and Sabrina over tomorrow I will be spending some time at a coffee shop finalizing my goals for next year and reflecting on this last year. I am really looking forward to taking the time to do that.
