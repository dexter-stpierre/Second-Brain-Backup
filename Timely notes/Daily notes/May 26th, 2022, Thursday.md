#### [[Journal]]

Today was a weird day. I got dinner with [[Josiah Christian]]. It was mostly fine. He asked a lot of questions that seemed to really be trying to lead me somewhere. He asked about my family. And then he started asking me about my faith. It honestly felt kind of intrusive to have someone just flat out ask me about that. It isn't something that I discuss much outside of Taylor and sometimes [[Alex Anderson]]. And honestly I am okay with that. I don't feel the need to discuss what my thoughts on God are all the time. It honestly just isn't a big part of my life anymore. It was kind of a slow fade to that, and I am okay with that just being where I am now. But the questions he was asking it felt like he was trying to show me that the reasons I am uncertain about God these days is for crappy reasons. That its all emotional and ungrounded. But in reality I think my faith was mostly emotional and ungrounded. So maybe the only way to separate myself from that was to do it emotionally. I don't know. I do know that I don't feel like I am missing something. He asked me what I base my truth in. I honestly don't feel a need for "truth" as Christians tend to refer to it. I'm not in a state of desperation, looking for a north star to guide me. I'm good, and just living my life the best way that I can. Helping those around me, and trying to make the world a slightly better place. I would however like more thought out answers to give to people if they ask questions like this. I didn't like feeling like I was at the mercy of his questions. I think that is the biggest thing that is bothering me. I think being peppered by questions like that was triggering in a way.
