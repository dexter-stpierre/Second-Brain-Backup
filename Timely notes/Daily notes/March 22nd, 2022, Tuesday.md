### [[Morning Routine]]

#### Prompts

##### [[What is Great in My Life Right now?]]

Taylor, the baby, Betty. I feel like most of my life is pretty great right now

##### [[When Do I Let My Self-belief Hold Me back?]]

As of right now I can't think of times that I have done this.

##### [[How Am I Making a Difference in This world?]]

Sometimes I feel like I'm not making a huge difference. And I feel okay with that sometimes, other times it feels like I'm going to have an existential crisis over it. In Christian circles you have everyone telling everyone that they are a "world changer" and talking about the deep and impactful conversations they had with someone. But now that I am removed from those circles that kind of talk feels weird. But I also know it is important to make some kind of difference. But right now for me I don't know what that is

### [[Evening Review]]

#### [[Journal]]

Today Taylor really came down with whatever I had over the weekend. She spent the entire day exhausted on the couch. I feel pretty bad because I am probably the one that got her sick. This morning at work we did a bug hunt for messages and one bug was found that prevented a roll out, and at this point it is looking like we might be pushing rollout back until Mitch comes back from PTO. Which is honestly fine by me. Since Taylor was sick I took the car for an oil change on my own, and then I got us Panera Bread for dinner. I spent about 3 hours doing grading from Prime. I am honestly feeling really meh. I don't know what's up.
