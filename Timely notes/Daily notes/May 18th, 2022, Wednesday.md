Today was mine and Taylor's 4th anniversary! Feels like it's been so much longer, and hard to believe we are already at 4. We went for a gondola ride out in [[Stillwater, MN]]. It was pretty fun. Taylor and the guy connected a lot, which was cool to see.

Today at work I realized that I reintroduced the bug with displaying search results, but since I had already written some basic test cases for that component it was really easy to make an additional one to test the data shape of a search result and ensure that it still works. So that's good. I think that the fact that the data is missing will be really obvious on some of the new displays, but it is what it is. Nothing I can do about that right now, and the team is aware that the data is missing.
