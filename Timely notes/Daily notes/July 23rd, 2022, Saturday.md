Today was the morning that we were at the JW Marriott for Taylor's birthday. We got room service, walked to get coffee, and went for a lap around the mall because Taylor's blood sugar was high. We ran into Davey and Nicole again in the parking garage, and then went to get my haircut. We found out that Alise didn't end up moving to Florida, so she was able to cut my hair. It had been a really long time since I had gotten it cut, it feels nice for it to not be as long anymore. Taylor's mom came over and helped us deep clean our room. She was really helpful with that. I talked with my aunt [[Christine St-Pierre]] for about 25 minutes tonight.
