### [[Evening Review]]

#### [[Journal]]

Just a random thought, but I should probably move my checklist of things I want to do in my daily review into Obsidian. I am way more reliable at opening this at night than I am at opening Todoist, so I think that will help me actually do all of the things that I want to do as part of that.

This morning we woke up early and went to [[Isabella Richards]]' volleyball game. It was fun. She did good serves, and even hit the ball a couple of times. They didn't land in, but hitting it is a big deal at her age! And we went to our first [[Minnesota Twins]] game of the season. It was great fun! They won by one point. When we got home we went on a walk and then I made dinner. After dinner I went to Target to get Taylor a [[Mother's Day]] gift. And while we were watching TikToks Taylor got a text from Sophia that she had her baby!
