    - Working on setting up the actual search now

### [[Evening Review]]
#### [[Journal]]

Today was for sure my most productive day of the week. I got more done today than I did in the whole rest of the week. I'd still like to see myself be a little more productive next week though. We had someone come to replace the bladder on our boiler today and he said that it should help our heat to be quieter and much more efficient, so that will be nice. I don't know what else to say I am feeling exhausted, but it is 11:30, so that makes sense
