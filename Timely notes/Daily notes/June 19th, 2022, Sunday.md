Today was my first Father's Day! Taylor took me out for breakfast, and then took me to Williams Sonoma and I ordered a nice stainless steel pan! Then we went to Express and I got a new shirt. Taylor also got me a cute book for the baby, and we got Bdubs for dinner. It was a really good day, and I really appreciate that Taylor celebrated me.
