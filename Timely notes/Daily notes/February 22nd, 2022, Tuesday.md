Today was a frustrating work day. I was fielding messages from Dharmishta all day, feeling like I could never get a consistent chunk of time to just focus on the work that I needed to do. There were at least 2 or 3 questions from her about things that were clearly stated in the ticket, or the designs and she just didn't actually look. Multiple tickets that were brought up that there were already tickets for, and lots of messages were she sent the issue over like 5 different messages. It was very frustrating. I feel like she comes to me the minute she sees something off and doesn't spend time digging into the issue to see what is up. I rarely get reproduction steps and she will reassign the ticket the moment she finds something wrong rather than finishing to test the ticket to see if there is anything else wrong. This leads to tickets bouncing between us like we are playing ping pong. It's very frustrating. I want to mention something to Josie, but I also don't want to risk Dharmishta getting in trouble. But I also don't know how to communicate the frustration.
