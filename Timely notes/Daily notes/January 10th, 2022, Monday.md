### [[Evening Review]]

#### [[Journal]]

Today was my first day going to Starbucks and working on my weekly review/planning. Today I only got 36 minutes to work on it and that was not enough time. I got the review part done, but didn't get any of the planning done. I should finish that tomorrow and ensure that I get a full hour of review/plan time for at least the first couple of months of doing it. I imagine that I can probably cut it down to about 45 minutes at that point, and then maybe even 30 minutes. Tomorrow morning I will do my weekly planning and my daily planning. 

Today was a semi productive day at work. Had a few good conversations planning how future features will be implemented, and helping other devs get PRs through. I hope to have a very productive day tomorrow. I will be presenting the messages to the dev team at the demo tomorrow and I am a little nervous. I have some things to finish up for sure, but I know that I can get it done. Taylor was very tired today, I think she took 3 or 4 naps. I can't blame her, she's building a whole baby. I made Arianne's potato soup for the first time today and Taylor liked it enough. She said the broth was just missing something to be very good.
