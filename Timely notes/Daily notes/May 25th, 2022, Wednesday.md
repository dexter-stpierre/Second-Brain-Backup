#### Prompts

##### [[Did you do anything today that reflects your most important core values?]]

Today I trained as a code coach for [[Prime Digital Academy]]. I think this will be a great way to pass on what I know and train up the next group of software devs.

#### [[Journal]]

I am pissed off. I think the tragedy of the school shooting in Texas that happened yesterday is weighing on me way more than I can admit. I try to take things in stride, but there is so much horror happening all around that I don't know how to cope with it anymore. I think i tried to cope today by playing video games, and I don't think it did me any good. I don't understand how the world we live in could be so fucked up. I don't understand why these things are happening, or how to make them stop. But I know that something needs to change.
