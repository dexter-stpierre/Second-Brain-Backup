Today was a fun day. We lingered in bed a little bit, which was really nice. I enjoy being able to have slow starts to our days. We went to half price books, Goodwill, and Target today. I got a stock pot which I am really excited about, and I got 3 new comic books, including the first volume of the Walking Dead. I am excited to start collecting that series. I went to Starbucks tonight while Taylor had Sabrina and Miranda over and I spent time reflecting on [[2021]] and setting goals/planning for [[2022]]. I am really looking forward to next year and all it has in store for us. It will be a really good year. I am glad that I have started to make a habit of doing reflective exercises, I think it will be really healthy for me and I am excited to see all the benefits I gain from it. Now that I am in the habit of doing my journaling every night and have communicated to Taylor that it is a priority for me I think I should add to it. I could benefit from doing 1-3 prompts each day
