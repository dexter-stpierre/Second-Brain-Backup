Today I got up early and went to the gym. It was nice to go when it wasn't so crowded. I was pretty distracted at work, but got through a decent amount of stuff still. Tonight we had slow cooker teriyaki chicken and had our new week baby date. And we also went for a walk around Lake Como. Then Taylor and I took time to just do our own thing for a while. She watched her shows and I played some ESO and watched an episode and a half of How I Met Your Father
