### [[Evening Review]]

#### [[Journal]]

Today I went to the gym. I am proud of myself for being disciplined with getting up early in the morning and either doing reviews, or going to the gym. I think tomorrow I will try to get up closer to 6 so that I have time for the gym and a review. I think it would be really nice to do both.

For work today I was pretty focused for most of the day. I knocked out Luke's entire punchlist from the meeting yesterday and in the morning I will be able to deploy that so that he can test it. Felt good to get as much done as I did. I didn't do a great job of tracking my time, but I will get better at that. Tomorrow my focus will be on getting the empty state done, and also figuring out the interactions between the list and the view sections of the page. That is something that I know I need to really nail. Right now it feels weird to do things like view, archive, or move messages and have things not update on the page as you would expect them to. 

Today Sean Masopust got arrested for sexual misconduct involving a student in his youth ministry. Reading about it the whole situation seems really fucked up, and it is heart breaking to read about. Especially since she most likely isn't the only one that he has done this to.

I cooked tacos for dinner tonight, but the meat I cooked ended up being bad, so we ate Bdubs instead. It was yummy, but I got too much and am not feeling the best now.
