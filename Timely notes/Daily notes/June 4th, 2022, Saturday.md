Today was exhausting. We got coffee with [[Alex Anderson]] and [[Natasha Anderson]] before [[Sam Tupy]] and [[Hailey Tupy]]'s baby shower. The coffee was really fun. And honestly the shower wasn't too bad either. Then we went to [[Melina Stapp]]'s wedding. It was pretty fun. Surprisingly one of the best conversations we had was with [[Sam Grosso]] talking about how kinds interact with technology
