Today I let myself sleep in until 7:15, and it felt SO good. I really needed the sleep, recognized it last night, and did what I knew I needed to do. I got up, made a coffee and made breakfast.

Work today was SUPER busy. I spent the day working through Luke's notes on the message board and got through everything. I spent an hour debugging an issue with trying to access a property of an undefined value. It was really hard to find, and then a one line fix.

Tonight I went to Xavier's wrestling match. He pinned his opponent in like 30 seconds. I'm proud of that kid. I also told Gmae, Daddy, and Christine about the baby today.
