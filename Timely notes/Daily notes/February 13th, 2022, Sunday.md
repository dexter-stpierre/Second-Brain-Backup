This weekend Taylor and I went to Chicago to go to the JP Saxes concert! We left our house around 5:15 am on Saturday and got back around 3:30 pm on Sunday. It was a super fast trip, but really really fun. It was the first time I have flown since COVID, and it was a good experience. I had imagined that a ton of flights were crazy, but everyone on our flights just calmly wore their masks. The concert was amazing, and the opening act, Trousdale, was pretty cool too. They gave me hardcore Civil Wars vibes.

Josh and Marie cam over and hungout with us to watch the Superbowl. It was a ton of fun, and pretty chill, which was exactly what we needed. I am a little bummed that I go back to work tomorrow and don't get a day off to chill, but that's okay.
