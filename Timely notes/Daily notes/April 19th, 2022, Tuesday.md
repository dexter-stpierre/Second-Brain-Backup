I am proud of myself for my workout today. I ran for one and a quarter mile, and the last half mile of so was at 6 mph, which I haven't done since I started running. So that is a big deal since it is faster, and longer than I normally do and I haven't ran much for the last 3 weeks or so. I wanna get into good shape for ultimate though. Work was fine. Finished up a small task, and moved on to starting the endpoint audit. I made chili for my lunches for the rest of the week. Taylor and I went for a walk when she got home and then we got Chipotle. We spent some time tonight discussing the layout of the baby room and our room, and then I played some Elden Ring
