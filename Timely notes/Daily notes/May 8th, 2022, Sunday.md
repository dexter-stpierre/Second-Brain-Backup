Today was Taylor's first mother's day, and I feel like i did a shitty job. First I waited until Friday to find a reservation for Mother's Day breakfast, so of course there wasn't anything available. I also didn't have a ton planned for the day, so I think she expected me to have more planned. Also, I made steaks for dinner and they didn't turn out very good. So I'm pretty disappointed in myself for how I did. I'm not very good at planning days like this, and I know they are really important to Taylor, so I know that the fact that I am not good at them is even worse. So yeah. Today I just feel like shit.
