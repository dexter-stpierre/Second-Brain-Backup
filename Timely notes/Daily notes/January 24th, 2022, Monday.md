This morning I went to Caribou to do my weekly review/planning. I was not able to finish the plan, but I think I got further than I did last week, so that's good. It's a process, and I'll figure it out. I got a lot done at work today, so that felt good. I am hoping I can get a lot done tomorrow too. I think I can push through most of what I have left for the sprint if I can really focus. 

[[Jack Carlson]] and I went to Kyotos and the Wild vs Habs game today. It was really fun. The wild crushed the Habs 8 to 2, but it was still fun to be there and watch the game.

I don't know if I am feeling drained just because of being out in the cold for so long, but I am very tired and sore.
