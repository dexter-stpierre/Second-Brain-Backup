Today was a good day. [[Taylor St Pierre|Taylor]] and I went to Yum Bakery and went through the updates that her Flow app had for the baby for this week. The baby resembles a shrimp and will be doubling in size over the next week, which is wild. I made us a salad for lunch and Taylor really liked it, which made me feel good. Then I went to see Spider-Man again with [[Rosendo St Pierre]] and [[Jesse Richards]]. It was excellent still the second time, but I am really glad that I went on release night. The energy was so exciting then. And tonight Taylor and I decided how we'll have the room for while she is pregnant and when the baby is in a basinet. We basically just pulled the bed further out of the alcove and switched sides. I am looking forward to tomorrow, we will be going to Target, Goodwill, and Half Price Books. Always a good time. Also, we received a check from our mortgage company for $950, so that's always nice.
