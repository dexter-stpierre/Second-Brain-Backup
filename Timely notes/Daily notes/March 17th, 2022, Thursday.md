This morning I went to the gym and rock climbed. I was feeling super demotivated so I didn't climb a ton, but it felt really good to do it anyways. I spent time this morning working through how to make the Layouts more configurable to allow the consumer to pass different breakpoints than what is default. I think I came up with a good solution, and the team seemed to like the one I cam up with. Guillaume was particularly thrilled, and made sure to use every option at his disposal to celebrate it. This afternoon it was mostly taking it easy, meetings, and Dharmishta found one bug that we will fix, but it isn't going to hurt the release timeline. Tonight we went to have dinner with Josh and Marie, which is always great. We tend to just sit and talk with them for a few hours every time we hangout, which is always nice! Taylor's cousin Ooper died by suicide today
