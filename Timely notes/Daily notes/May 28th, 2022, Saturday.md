I felt kind of cranky today. I am tired and don't really feel like journaling. There was a big storm that woke Betty up with thunder this morning and that really sucked. Then we got Caribou and went for a walk. We went to Menards to get paint for the baby room and I'll have to do the painting tomorrow, which I don't really wanna do. Jack came over and we got pizza and watched the first two episodes of Obi-wan Kenobi.
