- 14:30-14:56 (0 hours and 26 minutes)(26) [[14:00]]
    - [[1:1]] with [[Josie Wittwer]]
    	- Discussed how to prepare for presentations
        	- She told me to break down the presentation into an introduction, body, and conclusion, and to consider the following:
            	- What am I presenting: what is the focus of the presentation, what is my message, what do I want the audience to take away from it
            	- Who is my audience: If mostly developers then the technical aspects might be best to get into, if it is to the product department then demonstrating the product is best
            	- How am I presenting: Am I demonstrating the app live? Am I doing a powerpoint? Showing the old experience and how it compares to the new is good too.
            	- What state is the app in: if the app is WIP make sure to mention that. That way people don't mention little things that aren't perfect
            - Ending by asking if people have questions is always good.
            - If I don't want to be interrupted by questions I should state that at the beginning
        - Josie said my year end review will be the week of February 4th
        - The messages page is slated for release February 14th (likely to be pushed back)

### [[Evening Review]]

#### [[Journal]]

Today Taylor worked at 6, so we got up bright and early. It was hard to get up, but it was fine once I was out of bed. This morning I shaved for the first time in several months and it felt good. I am happy to have a clean face now. I also made a coffee and read some articles on my phone. It was a good, slow, morning.

Work was fine today. I was half focused for part of the day, so I was able to get a little bit of work done. I also had my 1:1 with Josie and asked for advice about giving demos and short, informal presentations. She gave me a lot of good advice, which I outlined above.

I really didn't feel like making more dishes to clean by making dinner at home, so we went out for dinner tonight. We had La Tapatia, which is a place we went back when I worked at Q3. They moved to a new location that has a dining room and it is super nice. We also watched The Woman in the Window. That was a wild movie.
