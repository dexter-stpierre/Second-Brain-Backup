Wow. Today Mike Todd at Transformation Church in Tulsa rubbed spit into his little brother's face as a sermon illustration. I think that might be one of the most disgusting sermon illustrations I have ever seen.

This morning we slept in a little bit so we did not have the breakfast we intended. We went to Starbucks instead. And then we went grocery shopping. We had Wendy's for lunch and then played some card games. I went to the gym today around 3. It was ridiculously busy. I should just get in the habit of going to the gym on weekday mornings instead of weekend afternoons. Maybe I could do some weight workouts on weekend afternoons, the weight room is way less busy than the climbing walls. For dinner today I made Riso al Forno. It is an italian rice dish that is similar to a baked risotto. I really enjoyed it and I am looking forward to getting to eat it for lunch this week. I also played ESO for the first time in a while.
