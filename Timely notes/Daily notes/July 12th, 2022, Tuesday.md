Wow, I am pooped. This morning started with taking Meghan to the airport at 4am, then I slept a little longer and then made breakfast burritos for the week. I worked all day and then I had Ultimate in the evening. It was the first week of zone defense and I really struggled with it. I had a really hard time keeping an eye on the people in my zone to be able to guard them. The game ended early because we had a ridiculous storm blow through. We went to Granite City after the game and that was actually really fun. I chatted with Josiah, Mason, and Alex and board games for a while, and a bunch of other stuff too. We might get together for some board games some time.
