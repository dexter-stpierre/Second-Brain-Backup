This morning while Taylor was at work I decided to finish painting the nursery. I knew that I wanted to get it done before the girls start staying with us tomorrow, and I decided to just get it out of the way by doing it this morning. She was super appreciative, and she really liked how it turned out. She said it was my best paint job. I didn't really do much at work. I had a really hard time focusing, and ended up just giving up and taking a nap.
