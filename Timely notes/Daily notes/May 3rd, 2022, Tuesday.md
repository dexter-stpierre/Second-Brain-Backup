### [[Morning Routine]]

#### Prompts

##### [[How can I increase the frequency of the feedback that I get?]]

Maybe looking for more feedback from different people. I tend to hope that feedback either will come from Josie or naturally arrive at me, but neither of those seem to be happening

### [[Evening Review]]

#### Prompts

##### [[What was something that I did for someone else today?]]

Today I noticed that Guillaume had implemented a messy workaround in his code to account for something that I had gotten wrong earlier. I went and fixed my mess up so that his code could be simplified

#### [[Journal]]

Today I decided that I will start following the Couch to 5K plan to get myself in shape, and train better. I think I could get there with the current way that I am training, but I don't think it will be the most effective way to achieve my main goal, which is better heart health. Today I was feeling really off and sad. I'm not really sure why. Taylor was good about trying to make my day better and I really appreciate thatToday Taylor is officially 24 weeks pregnant! So wild!
