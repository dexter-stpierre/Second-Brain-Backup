In my 1:1 yesterday Josie said that I probably won't become a senior dev at the mid year reviews, but probably will at the year end. Today I got on a call twice with one of our other senior devs and had to explain the basics of React Context. It feels like a thing that a senior react dev should know. It's pretty upsetting that even though I address so many things I have still not gotten the recognition that I deserve. Tonight we took care of a few things to get ready for the gender reveal on Sunday, and we got burgers in honor of Bill. I feel pretty irritated as I am getting ready for bed. I think it is just because I am very warm. Here's to hoping that I feel better in the morning.
