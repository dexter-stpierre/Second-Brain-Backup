Today we went to Taylor's cousin, Ooper's, funeral. It was cool to hear the impact that he had on so many people. I know that the Giller family has their issues, and I'm sure Ooper had plenty himself, but he really made an impact on his friends and family and it was cool to hear a little piece of that. I am kind of glad to have it in the rearview though, I was feeling a little anxious as it was approaching. 

Taylor went and hungout with Sophia today. They just moved a few minutes away so she is really looking forward to being able to hangout with her more, especially once their baby comes. While she was there I got our taxes done. We owe about $600 in federal, but are getting around $1300 in state, so we are netting around $700. I also played quite a bit of Elden Ring. I fought a boss that I was stuck on for a while. The thing that made a difference against the boss was going for melee attacks instead of range. It racked up damage way faster. A little further into the area I got stuck on a huge knight that was in a room that I needed to collect a key from. I ended up going to the round table and getting a mace that made a huge difference. At first I went there to get an item so I could use magic, but then I saw the mace and thought that might be even better. And it was.
