	- JS-722 <=991 Navigation
		- Need some way to map folders to icons.
			- Maybe the `NavItem` component could receive an icon prop that can be displayed below the breakpoint
			- Built an object that maps the folder type to the correct icon
				- Many of the icons were not in the project or in MaterialUI so I had to manually add them
				- I should consider adding all the icons for this as SVG icons since they are just so much easier to work with
			- Need to display the component and then hide it above the md breakpoint

- 12:39-13:35 (0 hours and 56 minutes)(56) [[12:00]] [[13:00]]
	- JS-722 <=991 Navigation
		- Refresh myself on where I was at in the process
		- reinstall dependencies
		- The screen is snapping to the tablet view at ~1280. This should happen at 991
			- Needed to move the breakpoints definition into the base theme.
			- I think there is something wonky going on with how these relate to each other
		- Adding Open Sans to the project through yarn and fontsource
			- https://fontsource.org/docs/getting-started
			- This worked great!

## [[Evening Review]]

### [[Journal]]

Today just felt like a day. It wasn't anything super special, just a day. Was fairly productive at work but nothing super significant, got a ton of laundry done, and watched the voice. But nothing felt special about today as a day. Not sure if that is a good or a bad thing. One really exciting thing is I got tickets for me and [[Jack Carlson]] to go see the new Spiderman movie on release day.
