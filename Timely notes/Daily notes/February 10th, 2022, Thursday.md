Today I am really starting to feel some weight of the messages project. I have had a full week of extreme focus, and I feel it's effect for sure. I feel tired and worn and like I need a little break. Even though it is a super short trip I am really looking forward to going to Chicago this weekend. I think it will be a much needed break from the stress of the project.

This morning I got up and went to the gym. I went on the treadmill and my intention was to do .25 miles at 3.5 mph, .5 miles at 5 mph, and then do .25 miles at 3.5. When I finished the .5 miles at 5 mph I was feeling good so I went for an extra .25 miles, for a total of .75 miles at 5 mph! I am proud of myself for doing that. I pushed myself a little bit and it is worth being proud of.

This afternoon we went to Taylor's 12 week appointment. We got to hear the baby's heartbeat for the first time! It's unreal to think that it is OUR baby in there. We are going to be parents. We are seriously so excited. After the appointment we went to Bennihanas to celebrate and then Quincy came over and we played ticket to ride.

I also chatted with Dada and Pedro a little bit this morning and told them about the baby! They were SO excited
