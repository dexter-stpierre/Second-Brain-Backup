This morning I cleaned out the fridge and we went grocery shopping. After shopping we went out to Mound to go on the boat with Taylor's dad. On the way there we got lunch at the drive in. We were out on the boat for about 3 hours and talked basically the whole time. Then we went to CJ's house to grab the air compressor and nail gun so I can get the trim back on in the baby's room. Then we came home to get the rest of the house ready for the maternity shoot tomorrow. We got pretty sunburnt out on the boat, which is a huge bummer with the shoot tomorrow.
