### [[Evening Review]]

#### [[Journal]]

Today was a productive day. Got up at 6:30 and went to the gym. Ran a mile. After that I made breakfast and chatted with Guillaume about the pro header. Got a couple of PRs merged, and reviewed a couple. In the React guild we discussed useful contexts, and codifying our permissions structure. After work I got some forms filled out, and got Morning Questions up and working for Obsidian, and made it in a way that setting up any kind of prompts will be ridiculously easy
