I felt a little blah today. I was pretty much on my phone all day and I feel like i wasn't intentional with my time. I think I might need to delete social media and readd the blocks for it. And delete the game that I installed. It is just so easy to get sucked in and that's not what I want for myself. Taylor and I did have a lot of good conversations about the baby though and how we want to prepare and plan for their arrival. Tomorrow Taylor will be 6 weeks so we are doing a breakfast date to see what is new with the baby and to talk more about our plans. I think that these weekly breakfast dates will be really beneficial for our planning process and our relationship. I am looking forward to it. Tomorrow I will also be seeing the new Spider-Man movie for the second time and I am really looking forward to that.
