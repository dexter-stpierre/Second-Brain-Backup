Today was an okay day. I went to Midas to get our serpentine belt replaced, and they told me that we will need a new catalytic converter soon too. Pretty annoying, I feel like there is always something wrong with our car. We got it so that there wouldn't always be something wrong with it. I spent most of my work day working on tests for the new specs of the message preview. Getting the tests working will also help to allow me to test more of the component in the future, which will help me ensure that we don't run into new regressions. [[Arianne Richards]] and [[Jesse Richards]] came over tonight and we grilled food. It was the first time I have grilled this grilling season, it felt nice to do it again.
