This morning Taylor and I had Meranda Blumburg take some photos of us for us to use for our baby announcement. We had them taken at Target and filled up a cart with baby items and took pictures with it. It was so much fun. Some of the workers saw us doing it and said that it made their day.

Yesterday when we were at the baby appointment there was a lot of chatter in Slack about things that had gone wrong in the messages stuff. Turned out the most of it was due to either a lack of understanding the requirements, or were very small fixes. So while it felt a little overwhelming to see all of them, it ended up not being a big deal. And thankfully Nick and Ryan were both very understanding. I shared with my team today that Taylor is pregnant and they were very excited for us. I also called Josh and he was pumped for us, and said that he will be be talking about it with me a lot in the coming weeks. When I had a call with Luke today he said he would like to meet for coffee in the next few weeks to get to know each other a little bit.

Tonight Rachel came over. I think that Taylor doesn't get as much from that friendship as she should and it is very sad. But I think if she mentioned that to her Rachel would be very understanding and make efforts to do better. But I don't think that it is my place to interject on that. After they left we dropped Betty off at Cooper's house and now we are off to Chicago in the morning!

## Notes

- Issue -  Action tool bar does not display all icon When user select more than 3   messages via checkbox ![:thread:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/13.0/apple-medium/1f9f5@2x.png)
    - Third message selected is a system message and therefore cannot be moved, so the unavailable actions (move & archive) are hidden.
- Multi messages selected pane does  Action tool bar display  for all  folder (Notification , Archived, All Messages )?![:thread:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/13.0/apple-medium/1f9f5@2x.png
    - Same as above, a system message is selected therefore move and archive are no longer options
-  I was doing testing for web tickets and had parents both a and b go to expenses and its coming up with errors.
    - Not worried about it until this is in preprod
- Action  Item folder is not displaying in Murmur env - do we have any story call out for remove this folder ?
    - This is a backend thing
- [JS-1006](https://ourfamilywizard.atlassian.net/browse/JS-1006)
    - This needs to be fixed
- some question  on Download
    - This needs to be fixed
- Speed bump does not display when archiving
    - I'll look into this
- Shared with my coworkers that Taylor is pregnant and everyone was happy for us!
