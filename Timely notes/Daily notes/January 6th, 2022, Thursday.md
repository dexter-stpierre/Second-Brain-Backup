### [[Evening Review]]

#### [[Journal]]

Transferred $900 from savings to checking to pay for heating work

Today I got to tell Josie that Taylor is pregnant! She was SO excited! She said the one piece of advice that she would give is that you are never going to feel ready to have the kid come, but when they do you will figure out everything you need to. I thought that was good advice. I was much more productive at work today than I have been in the past. It felt good to be that productive. I still was nowhere near the level that I want to be, but still much better than I have been any other day this week. I am looking forward to tomorrow because the only meting I have is stand up so I feel like I will be able to be pretty productive. Taylor and I hungout tonight. I made chicken and rice soup. I feel like that is one of the bigger recipes that I need to spend time working on. I would really like to be better at making it but I feel like it is missing something when I make it, I just can't figure out what. Taylor felt like garbage after dinner though. I feel really bad. And it is super hot upstairs. I wish that the temperatures could be better regulated.
