Today was the last day with Cooper. I feel like the time that we had him went by so fast. The first was felt horrible, then after that it was really fast. I haven't been able to focus at work at all, I think the whole not having a big project that I am working on really takes a tole. I need to use my own organization to find a way to represent the work that I need to get done better, in a way that makes it feel more urgent.
