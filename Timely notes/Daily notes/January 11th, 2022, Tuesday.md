### [[Morning Routine]]

I think my main goal is to accomplish everything on my todo list. It really isn't much stuff, and I believe that it is possible.

	- Logging off for the day. I feel like I did a poor job in the demo today, and that is something that I really want to improve on. I'd like to talk with Josie during my next 1:1 to figure out how to do that better

### [[Evening Review]]

#### [[Journal]]

Well I didn't accomplish everything on my todo list, but that's okay. I had a couple of meetings and was confused on how much time I had for certain things. I think tomorrow after I walk Taylor to her car I will take time to focus on the things on my todo list. In the afternoon I will really focus on knocking out a few work tasks. I think this should give me plenty of time to accomplish my most important things for the day

I think this has been the hardest day of pregnancy for Taylor. She had a hard time deciding what she wanted for food and felt awful when we got home from dinner. I feel really bad that she is feeling so awful.
