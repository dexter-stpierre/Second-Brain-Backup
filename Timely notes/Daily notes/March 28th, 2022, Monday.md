Everyone is talking about the whole Will Smith punching Chris Rock at the Oscars last night and a lot of people are saying that if he wasn't famous and at the Oscars he would be sitting in jail. I think it's pretty telling that a lot of people think that someone would go to jail for slapping someone

Work was pretty simple today. nothing too exciting, I was also super unfocused today.

We had my mom over for dinner today. Having her over for dinner is always interesting. Every time we talk ever since they started looking for a house that has more land that is the primary thing that she talks about. She doesn't really ask us questions about us and our lives. She just wants to talk about what is going on in her life. She rambles on and on and if there is ever a lul in conversation she just jumps right back in with something about her instead of asking a question. If we mention something going on in our lives she jumps in with an anecdote of something from her life and goes on a tangent about that. It is a very frustrating dynamic. She didn't even ask me about work once today. and we literally just released a project that was the culmination of about a year of work. Yet no questions about work. I wonder if I should say something about the fact that she does this when we talk, but I am not sure I want to deal with how she will respond. But me deciding that she would respond a certain way without giving her the chance to respond isn't fair either. I think I should say something and then see what she does. I think that would be the most fair thing to do
