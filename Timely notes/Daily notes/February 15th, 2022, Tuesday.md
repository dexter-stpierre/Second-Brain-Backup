I am super proud of my workout this morning. I ran for 1 mile at 5 mph. It was tough, I wanted to give up, but I did it and I still feel good. Tomorrow I will do a climbing workout, and I am really looking forward to it. I think climbing less often will make those times more enjoyable, and I feel like I will go harder when I do it.

Today was an okay day at work. I spent most of the day working on the responsive select messages. I got it working, which is good. I think I will just push what I have, and spend some time refactoring it once I finish the rest of the bugs. I think that will be the best way to spend my time. I talked with [[Zahid Abdikadir]] a little bit. He congratulated me on the baby, and we talked a little bit about his job search. I told him I would do what I can to help him find a gig. Today I also got the gig of Code Reviewer with [[Prime Digital Academy]]. I think this will be a really interesting job and I am looking forward to it. It is a very part time job, so I will keep on working at [[OFW]] full time.
