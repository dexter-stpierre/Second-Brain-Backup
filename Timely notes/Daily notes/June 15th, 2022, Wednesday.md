Today was Taylor's first attempt at the 3 hour glucose test. I say first attempt because she ended up puking it all up about 15 minutes after taking the drink. She will be trying the test again tomorrow, and her mom will be going with her. She said this is the last time she will take it, it isn't worth throwing up a bunch of times when plenty of people don't even take this test. At work I spent the day fixing up messages tweaks bugs. The release was tentatively scheduled for tomorrow, but there is no way that is going to happen. I'm feeling pretty unmotivated at work these days. I think it will make sense to start looking for other roles after my parental leave. Tonight was my first day of [[Code Coach]]ing for [[Prime Digital Academy]]. It was pretty good. Only 3 students showed up, but I think they got a lot out of it.
