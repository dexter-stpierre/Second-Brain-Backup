I honestly don't think I did anything today besides that code review. I was wiped out, and needed to take a nap this afternoon. It honestly didn't help much. I have no idea why I was so tired. I really hope I can be more productive tomorrow. I'll make a coffee when Taylor leaves, get a couple of personal things done, and then I'll probably start work good and early so I can get lot's done before standup. 

Tonight I got together with Macy's boyfriend Thomas. He is a para at a high school and an aspiring web dev. It was fun to hangout with someone new and get to share a little bit about development. Tomorrow I should shoot him some good blog posts for a beginner level developer.
