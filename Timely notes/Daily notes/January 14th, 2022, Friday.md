Today was our first baby appointment!! The baby is healthy and growing at the right speed and I am obsessed. It was such a relief to hear that the baby is alive and well.

I worked at a coffee should called Third space cafe, and it was so good! I really liked the panini I got. It was turkey and so good. I also got bottomless coffee, which was good and I got SO much work done. I was more productive in my half day today than I was all of this week.
