Today we had the appointment with Taylor's dietician to learn more about how to manage her gestational diabetes. She thinks that we should be able to manage it well enough with changes to her diet, she shouldn't need to take any insulin. The big thing is just watching how many carbs she has each meal, and balancing them with protein and fat. So I think we should end up in a good enough spot.
