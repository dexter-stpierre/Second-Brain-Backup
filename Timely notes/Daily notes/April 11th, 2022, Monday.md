This morning we went down to LA for a tour. Before the tour we went to Bluey for breakfast. I just found it by looking around on Google Maps and the tour guide said that it was a hidden gem that the locals love. It was really good, but really expensive. The tour was super fun. It was fun to learn a ton about the different areas in LA. The guide was an interesting person. I disagreed with him on a lot of things, but he was pretty good at talking about the areas of the city that he knows and loves. After the tour we got lunch at Tacos Por Favor and the tacos I got were amazing. After that we went down to Venice beach and sat in the sand. We got changed in the bathroom, and they were super gross. Then we came back to the Airbnb, ate dinner here, read, and played some Mario Kart
