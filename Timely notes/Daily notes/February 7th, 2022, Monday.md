Today I did not get to do a weekly review/plan. I think I'm okay with that, it was a VERY busy day. I'll do a small one tomorrow. This morning I drove all the Ewing kids to school, and got a coffee at Starbucks. It was good, but I am looking forward to making my coffee tomorrow. I have high expectations.

For work today I was completely focused on just getting the mobile navigation working. The tablet navigation presented some minor challenges with just getting things to not be jumpy, and rendering the right buttons. The mobile nav was tricky but I think I came up with a good solution. There is a state hook in the index file that controls opening and closing the mobile nav, and I added the scrim behind it. And then I display the message with a back button that just navigates them back in the navigation stack. It was pretty simple, but I'm glad that I got it figured out. It will be really interesting to abstract it out. There are some things with it that I think will be very difficult to figure out, and some things that I think will be made easier because of the abstraction. Tomorrow I will focus on polishing the mobile nav, and completing Luke's small punch list. I think it will be pretty straight forward to tackle all of the items on it, none of them were overly difficult.

This afternoon I picked up Amelia from school and drove her to the school where she is helping to teach elementary school kids to play instruments. I also picked up Charlie and him and I played some Smash while Zach was at a church thing. When I picked up Zach from church him and I went to Chick-Fil-A
