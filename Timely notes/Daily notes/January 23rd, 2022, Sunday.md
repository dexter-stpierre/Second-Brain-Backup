Today Taylor made us banana waffles for breakfast and I made hashbrowns to go with them. It was a yummy breakfast. Then we cleaned out the fridge and I went grocery shopping. We spent most of the day watching the divisional round of the NFL playoffs. There was some really great games. Super fun to watch. I made some chili for my lunches this week since there won't be many left overs to eat for lunches since we have so many dinner plans this week. I think it is my best batch of chili I have ever made

During the games I texted a lot with [[Alexandre St-Pierre]]. It was fun to bond over the games. Also, [[Ian Burt]] reached out and we texted a little bit. He told me that him and his girlfriend broke up and that he is gonna move back to MN. I also told him about the baby.

When Taylor was heading up she asked me if I was gonna come up with her and I told her that I liked to have a few minutes to myself before heading up and she didn't seem to like that. I feel a little bad, but also it is something that I consider to be important for myself, and I want to be able to prioritize those kinds of things.
