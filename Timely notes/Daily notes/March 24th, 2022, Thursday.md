Today was the first day of rolling out messages. So far we haven't had any major issues, and things are looking pretty good on LogRocket, which is really good. We have Cooper staying with us right now, and he got a little aggressive when playing with Betty today. He bit her at the throat and was keeping her down and throwing her around. Betty was yelping super loudly and I had to run out there and yell at Cooper. I could tell that Betty was pretty hurt by it, but thankfully she wasn't seriously injured. I was super shook by it though. Thankfully I was able to call Taylor and she was able to talk me through it quick. I'm really glad that she wasn't home, or she probably would have been able to keep her composure about it.

Taylor got together with [[Kath Griffin]] today. I think that getting together really settled for Taylor how unhealthy the relationship was for her, and how healthy her current ones are now. Kath ended up being drunk, and mostly just talked about her own life and gossiped about her friends. She didn't really ask Taylor anything about her. Taylor doesn't need a friend like that in her life, she worked so hard to get rid of those kinds of friends.

Tonight I attend a job fair with Our Family Wizard and it was really fun. I got to meet a few of my coworkers who I've never seen in person, and got to meet lots of people looking for jobs. Unfortunately we aren't hiring for React engineers, but we met a few people for the mobile and UX roles.

## Notes

flex-wrap: wrap;
max-height: calc(40px * 2.5);
overflow-y: auto;
