#### [[Journal]]

This morning I slept in since we got home late from the play yesterday. I got up around 7:10 and just sat around. At work today I finished some tech debt tickets and started working on the paginated message list. I think I should be able to finish that tomorrow morning, and hopefully finish the select all and message preview features tomorrow. That would be a great spot to be in to finish out the week. This afternoon we went to the OBGYN for Taylor's 16 week checkup. We heard the heartbeat, and it was still magical like the first time. We deposited the check from the insurance company and we watched Grey Anatomy
