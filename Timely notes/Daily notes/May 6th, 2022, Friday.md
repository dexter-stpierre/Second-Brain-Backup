### [[Morning Routine]]

#### Prompts

##### [[How Was My sleep?]]

Ironic that I get thing prompt on Friday, when Taylor works at Caribou and we wake up at 5 am. My sleep was fine, but no where near long enough. I'm still very tired and just wanna go back to bed. But I know that I should take advantage of this time to get some stuff done

##### [[What Interesting Ideas Did I Come across?]]

Not sure I came across any very interesting ideas today. However I encountered a few things at work that are worth giving some considerable thought. Or maybe considerable research.

I think that the expenses filters might be overkill. I'm not sure we even have any kind of filtering today. I think simple filters would be much more prudent

#### [[Journal]]

Today I was actually able to get a decent amount of stuff done in the morning before work. I think having social media blocked on my laptop was really helpful in that effort. I was able to get dishes done, read some articles, and do other things that I really needed to do. During work I had several things come up, from handling getting updates to the shared component library out to all the devs, how to handle a weird kind of form field, and an issue with the search field being laggy. These are all things that I am going to give some thought to on Monday. Tonight Taylor and I went to the Girl Named Tom concert! It was a blast, and I really like some of the original music that they sang. There was one song in particular that I really like, it had an electro-swing vibe to it
