This morning we got up around 9:30 and had a hard time deciding what to do for the morning. Taylor wasn't sure what she wanted for breakfast, but we ended up settling on Starbucks. Taylor said that she felt like we were really out of sync this morning, but I didn't really feel that way. Taylor went and had lunch and spent the afternoon with [[Natasha Anderson]]. I stayed home and played some [[Elden Ring]] and got started on the paint in the baby room. The baby room really didn't take as long to paint as I thought it would, it took a little under 3 hours, and that was doing it all by myself. Taylor made us the Trader Joes orange chicken for dinner and we watched an episode of SVU. Taylor's mom called her and talked for a while about how crazy her whole family was bing and how rude they were to her. She decided to take some space to take care of herself, which I think is a really good idea. Her whole family is going through a lot with Ooper's death, but that doesn't mean it's okay for her family to take it out on her. We watched TikToks for a little bit tonight and one of them was about Applebees and that sounded SO good so we went and got half price apps last minute
