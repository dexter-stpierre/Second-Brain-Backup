This was a pretty tiring day. Taylor and I were both dead tired. The only reason we managed to drag ourselves out of bed is because Taylor had a breakfast with [[Molly Wollner]]. Otherwise we would not have gotten up today. After Taylor left I sat around for like an hour, then I went outside and started working in the yard. I pulled up all of the [[Japanese Knotweed]] that we had back by the garage, then I mowed. I tried to weed whack, but our weed whacker always ends up shutting itself off. And my arms were too tired to keep on starting it up. I'll have to do that another time. I also went grocery shopping today.
