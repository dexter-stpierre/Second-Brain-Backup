This morning I really wanted to go on a breakfast date so Taylor and I went to Original Pancake House. I got a super good omelette with hollandaise sauce and Taylor got chocolate chip pancakes. It was a super good breakfast. We also went to say goodbye to the Bakers because they are getting ready to move to North Carolina. Super exciting for them. They are for sure Taylor's people though. I always chat with Mike, but I for sure don't feel a huge connection, which is fine. Then we came home and hung around. We played tons of card games today. It was nice to have a whole day where we were together literally all day, especially since we had such a bust week.
