We are having a son!!!! Today was dedicated to our gender reveal. We went to Hope Breakfast Bar and then the entire rest of the day was gender reveal. We finished decorating, set out stuff for the food, and hungout with so many of our friends and family. It was a really amazing day. We had so many people I don't think our house could have possibly handled more people. But it was so amazing to see everyone. After the reveal Taylor and Meghan when to Target to get things for the baby. John offered to buy us something that was expensive and that we didn't want to ask someone else to get, so he is getting our crib, which is our last big piece of furniture. We are driving Meghan to the airport at 3 am
