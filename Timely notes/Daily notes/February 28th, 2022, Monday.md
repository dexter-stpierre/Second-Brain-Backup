This morning I got up and went to Caribou for my weekly planning. I didn't get it all done and I plan to do more tomorrow. Work was not super eventful, I got some stuff done but not an impressive amount. Today Rosendo said that they won't be able to go to Waitress with us because they have Bible study on Sunday and that is the only time where our schedules would align. I pretty annoyed that he didn't just tell me that yesterday. Now we have wasted 24 and we have to see if someone else will go with us. I asked Josh, we'll see what he says.
