### [[Journal]]

Today was a pretty fine day. I overslept a little bit, so I didn't have an easy going morning like I sometimes like to have. But that's fine. I had avocados and a bagel for breakfast. I spent the day reworking how the modal resizing works for the React modals fast follows. I had to implement a library to handle the resizing apporiately for Safari. I should do a writeup on it tomorrow. Taylor hung out with Nat today and I spent a good chunk of the evening looking through and organizing my tasks and notes, getting ready to do a version of a weekly review. We watched the voice after she got home and now we are getting ready to go to bed and read for a little bit.
