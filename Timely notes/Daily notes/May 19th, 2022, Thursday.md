#### Prompts

##### [[What made me sad?]]

Taylor made some comments today about me saying weird stuff. It honestly hurt my feelings pretty bad. I said something about it and she said something like I'm sorry you took it that way. Which is a form of blame deflection that she really doesn't like.

#### [[Journal]]

Today I went to the gym. I was just 0% motivated and didn't want to work out. People say if you just get your gym clothes on, or just drive to the gym, you'll end up working out. That's just not the case for me. I was _this_ close to just driving out of the gym parking lot and going to McDonalds for breakfast. But I worked out anyways. Today was mostly working on test cases for the attribution line again, and working out some warnings in our test suite. [[Matt Stanton]] sent me an interesting HackerNoon post from a guy who felt like we was isolated on his team due to knowing too much, being too trusted, and being too productive. I think he is worried about me becoming that way. There was a super bad hail storm tonight, it came out of no where and we had some pieces that were almost golfball sized. It was wild.
