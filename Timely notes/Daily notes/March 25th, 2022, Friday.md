This morning I spent about an hour and a half reading [[Hypothesis Testing]] to catch up for the book club, and ultimately didn't end up finishing the reading, and took the book club time to keep working. I had my [[1:1]] with Josie today. I mentioned the next baby appointment, and Ooper's funeral. She congratulated me on the first little bit of the messages rollout, and said that she wants me to speak at the next all company product meeting. I don't know how I feel about speaking at that, but I'll take the congratulations. She still hasn't brought up a promotion for me, so at my next 1:1 I'll have to mention that for sure. I feel a little bit of that uncertainty demotivation, I'm not sure what to do about that. I should maybe mention that to Josie.

I picked up my new glasses after work today and I really like the way I look in them. I think they fit my face really well. And I can see SO much better with them. I've felt a little queasy since I got them, but that should go away in time. I am interested to see how they will be driving at night. I have a bad astigmatism, and I really hope we got the prescription right to help that
