Today was a pretty good day. Slept in a little bit, and then got up and played some Pokemon before meal prepping our breakfast for the week. The prep went well, although it made a little less than I was expecting. I think it's just because the loose sausage that I made last week took up a lot more space than the links I used this week. I think I wanna try making frozen burritos for meal prep, especially for when the baby comes. Would be much easier to just pull them out of the freezer the night before, and throw them on the george forman.

Work today was okay. I was able to get a decent way through the calendar lint issues, but now I am on a component that is especially difficult. I am considering doing what I can, and adding the ignore comments to the things that are too complex to fix. That feels like the best path forward. I think Nick was unaware of how soon my parental leave is, so we had a meeting and portioned out the stuff that I am working on so that I can get to the highest priority things, and leave the lower priority things for Chad to handle while I am on leave.

We also had a meeting to discuss the shared component library. I honestly think we are taking an over engineered approach to the problem. And I think it is still going to have the same negative repercussions, but they will honestly be harder to see. Since the code isn't living in the same repo it will be harder to get and idea of where different components are used, and the possible side effects of changes. We will almost certainly have to either duplicate types, or also move types to the shared library codebase. And the shared library will complicate development. Symlinks can be finicky, and cause confusion about what code is actually being used. Is the code in the shared library the published version, or the version on my machine? We will probably need to go to the repo and checkout the latest version of the shared library code to ensure that it is up to date. There's also the question of how the code gets published. How do we ensure that the branches we need get published, and that the next release gets published before a deploy of the react app. I think we are recreating the issues we experience with the web common repo, just with more complicated issues.

Tonight was Ultimate. I had Arbys before and it was good. I got the half pound, and it was honestly too much. I think I'll just stick with the double from now on. Ultimate was great and I really learned a ton today. I think my biggest take away is that if we are playing zone and the person who was in my zone gets the disc just go immediately to my zone relative to the receiver, don't run up to them. 

#### Notable News

- House passed a bill codifying gay marriage. Hopefully it can pass in the senate. About a third of the house republicans voted yay, if is similar % of senate republicans do too it will pass.
