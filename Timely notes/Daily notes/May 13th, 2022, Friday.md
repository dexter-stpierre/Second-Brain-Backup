Haven't really journaled the last couple of days, but I wanted to take a moment to write about the last few days. We have been in Waco since Thursday night. We are here to celebrate [[Meghan Fletcher]] graduating with her masters degree!! It's been so fun seeing Waco and Baylor and just spending time celebrating her. We are SO proud of her
