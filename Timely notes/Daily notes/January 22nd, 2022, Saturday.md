This morning I made us a big breakfast, bacon, hashbrowns, eggs, and a cheese sauce. I think it turned out pretty well. I think I'd make the hashbrowns on the griddle next time instead of a pan, which means I could also cook my eggs on there. Bacon in the oven for a big breakfast is the way to go though.

For lunch we had shrimp tacos. They were just okay and Taylor started not feeling well right before they were ready. I did a ton of dishes, and we played a few games of Ticket to Ride this afternoon. Then we watched the divisional games of the NFL, and both #1 seeds lost, which you just love to see. We had Chipotle for dinner, and it was super yummy. I also made the meal plan tonight. I would like to figure out a way to make it easier. Maybe making it part of some other process in my life would be better. Maybe a mid week get ahead session, which would be focused on getting myself ahead in certain key areas of my life. I feel that it would be too big of a haul for my weekly reviews, but could maybe fit in well during some other part of the week, like Friday mornings when Taylor goes to work.
