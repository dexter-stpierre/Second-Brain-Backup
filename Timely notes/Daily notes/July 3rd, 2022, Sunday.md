Today was our baby shower! It was so fun to have Taylor get home and go through all of the gifts together! There were a lot of people who were still able to come, even with Taylor getting Covid. Her aunts made a quilt for the baby with an animal for each letter of the alphabet embroidered on it. It must have taken so much work. They all learned how to embroider just to participate in this project for us. It was so sweet.
