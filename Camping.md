# Camping

## Suggestions From Craig

- #1: Glendalough: My favorite…3 extremely clear lakes, hardly busy, and within normal driving distance!

- #2: Lake Shetek: This one is fantastic. It is a little bigger, but the lake is beautiful and so is the area. You can camp right along the lake.

- #3: Split Rock Creek: Another quiet park, especially this time of year. It is smaller, but it is right on the water. In the Southwest corner of the state.

- #4: Father Hennepin: A small, but really nice park on the Southeast Side of Lake Mille Lacs.

- #5: Moose Lake: Up I-35, but not in the North Shore. Pretty cool place with a really nice lake.

- #6: Frontenac: You can’t camp next to the river, but during the fall, this one is BEAUTIFUL! Just southeast of us.

- #7: Whitewater: A really beautiful park, especially in the Fall. You can camp right by the river.

- #8: Monson Lake: Kind of by where Alex goes in Starbuck. A really pretty lake and you can camp right next to it.

- #9: Interstate: This one is close to me and in Taylor’s Falls. It is a cool area with cliffs along the St. Croix and you can camp right by the river:

- #10: Myre-Big Island: Just outside Albert Lea, it is a straight shot down I-35. The lake is really nice and you camp pretty close to the shoreline.
