- But we lack a framework for how individual employees can use small batch sizes to their advantage. If each worker in this new economy really is a Startup of One, wouldn’t it make sense for us to use the same approach that has revolutionized manufacturing, software development, and startups?

- What is keeping us from realizing this vision, I believe, is a mistaken assumption. This assumption is revealed when we ask the question: What is the “inventory” of knowledge work? What is the information age equivalent to the raw materials that flow through a factory? ([Location 202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FLQHLTK&location=202)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85312323) ^rw85312323

- But tasks are not inventory — they are nothing but abstract units of organization. No company “sells” tasks to their customers, and no employer will pay you for a completed to do list. The inventory of knowledge work is ideas. What you are selling, as a “worker of knowledge,” are the ideas you’ve “processed” through the focused application of your attention. ([Location 207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FLQHLTK&location=207)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85312324) ^rw85312324

- If ideas are the inventory of knowledge work, then reducing our batch sizes requires changing not how we manage tasks and projects, but how we manage the information content of those projects. ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FLQHLTK&location=214)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85312325) ^rw85312325

- We need to change our conception of what we are producing, from final deliverables to what I will call “intermediate packets.” Instead of seeing the final product (the deliverable we sell to the client) as the only repository of value, we package up all the intermediate steps — the research, notes, brainstorms, examples, outlines, prototypes, drafts, and even crazy ideas we choose not to pursue — as reusable components for later consumption. ([Location 216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FLQHLTK&location=216)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85312326) ^rw85312326

- If we see our work as creating these intermediate packets, we can find ways to create value in any span of time, no matter how short. Productivity becomes a game of matching each available block of time with a corresponding packet of value. ([Location 224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07FLQHLTK&location=224)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85312327) ^rw85312327
    - Date:: [[September 11th, 2020, Friday]]
- But if your only goal is to create an intermediate packet and show it to someone — good notes on a book, a Pinterest board of design inspirations, just one module of code — then you can trick yourself into getting started. And even if that particular Big Project doesn’t pan out, you’ll still have the value of the packets at your disposal.

- After you’ve been working this way for awhile, there is a final benefit: you gain the ability to complete entire projects merely by assembling previously built packets. There seems to be a critical mass in a given industry or area — once you reach that mass, each additional packet added creates exponential value in the connections it creates with others.

- So what is required to make this new approach a reality? It requires us to get much, much better at packaging our work mid-stream. Here’s what makes it difficult: we can’t afford to do this packaging during the project, because every spare moment is needed to race toward the deadline. And we can’t do it after the project ends, because by then we’re already off to the next one. No, this packaging has to be embedded into the actual way we work moment to moment, so that it doesn’t take any extra time whatsoever.

- Instead, they optimize for productive randomness, for serendipity, for seemingly bizarre juxtapositions of apparently unconnected information to train our capacity for connecting it. Each person possesses a unique lifestream of information from numerous sources, and success increasingly depends on curating, tweaking, redirecting, and capturing value from this stream to use in our work. Instead of hiding our insights and learnings in neatly labeled folders and files, we want to expose them as intermediate packets of ever-evolving, intermediate work.

- Note-taking apps, simply put, are our best option for “bending” productivity to the ebb and flow of our days, and for managing the work-in-process inventory of ideas that represents our biggest asset as knowledge workers.
