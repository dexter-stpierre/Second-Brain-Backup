- This book is full of advice that works better if embraced in its totality but is still useful when applied piece by piece. ([Location 115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=115)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54386090) ^rw54386090
    - Date:: [[April 16th, 2020, Thursday]]
- Getting Things Done deals primarily with the content and meaning of what we need to manage, irrespective of how it shows up or gets organized—whether in digital form or on paper—advances in technology are to some degree irrelevant to the essence of its methodology. ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=176)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54386091) ^rw54386091

- the entire world’s digitally connected literate population is the recipient of an explosion of nonstop, potentially “important”—or at least relevant—information. ([Location 196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=196)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54386092) ^rw54386092
    - Date:: [[April 16th, 2020, Thursday]]
- Anyone with the need to be accountable to deal with more than what he or she can complete in the moment has the opportunity to do so more easily and elegantly than in the mind.

    - Date:: [[April 16th, 2020, Thursday]]
- The core message of the book is so inherently relevant to the human condition that I’ve yet to experience any cultural bias—nor frankly any gender, age, or personality-type differentials—in the applicability of the methodology.

- there is a much more universal interest in the results that can be achieved with relaxed, focused control, and the realization that it is not just a one-shot recipe of “time management” tips simply for business professionals, but in fact a lifestyle practice, necessary to deal with the new world most all of us are experiencing.

- this book is not so much concerned with getting things done as it is championing appropriate engagement with your world—guiding you to make the best choice of what to do in each moment, and to eliminate distraction and stress about what you’re not doing.

- Everything in life worth achieving requires practice. In fact, life itself is nothing more than one long practice session, an endless effort of refining our motions. When the proper mechanics of practicing are understood, the task of learning something new becomes a stress-free experience of joy and calmness, a process which settles all areas in your life and promotes proper perspective on all of life’s difficulties. —Thomas Sterner ([Location 245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=245)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54386098) ^rw54386098

- The art of resting the mind and the power of dismissing from it all care and worry is probably one of the secrets of our great men. —Capt. J. A.

- As to methods there may be a million and then some, but principles are few. The man who grasps principles can successfully select his own methods. The man who tries methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have trouble. —Ralph Waldo Emerson ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=310)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54386101) ^rw54386101

    - Date:: [[April 16th, 2020, Thursday]]
- (1) capturing all the things that might need to get done or have usefulness for you—now, later, someday, big, little, or in between—in a logical and trusted system outside your head and off your mind; ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=399)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54386109) ^rw54386109
    - Date:: [[April 16th, 2020, Thursday]]

    - Date:: [[April 16th, 2020, Thursday]]
- A paradox has emerged in this new millennium: people have enhanced quality of life, but at the same time they are adding to their stress levels by taking on more than they have resources to handle. ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=414)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54386113) ^rw54386113

    - Date:: [[April 16th, 2020, Thursday]]
- not only are work and its cognitive boundaries more ambiguous and ill defined, so are the time and space within which we can (and often should) be engaged with it, along with the continuing explosion of potentially meaningful and accessible data that could add value to our lives. ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=440)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54386115) ^rw54386115
    - Date:: [[April 16th, 2020, Thursday]]
- The relative speed of changes in our cultures, lifestyles, and technologies are creating greater necessity for individuals to take more control of their unique personal situations, more often. ([Location 465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=465)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54386116) ^rw54386116
    - Date:: [[April 16th, 2020, Thursday]]
- we haven’t been well equipped to deal with this huge number of internal and external commitments. ([Location 472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=472)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54386117) ^rw54386117
    - Date:: [[April 16th, 2020, Thursday]]
- Neither our standard education, nor traditional time-management models, nor the plethora of digital and paper-based organizing tools available has given us a viable means of meeting the new demands placed on us.

    - Date:: [[April 16th, 2020, Thursday]]
- Ineffective personal organizational systems create huge subconscious resistance to undertaking even bigger projects and goals that will likely not be managed well, and that will in turn cause even more distraction and stress.

    - Date:: [[April 16th, 2020, Thursday]]
- Focusing on primary outcomes and values is a critical exercise, certainly. It provides needed criteria for making sometimes-difficult choices about what to stop doing, as well as what most ought to have our attention amid our excess of options. But it does not mean that there is less to do, or fewer challenges in getting the work done.

    - Date:: [[April 16th, 2020, Thursday]]
- There has been a missing piece in our culture of knowledge work: a system with a coherent set of behaviors and tools that functions effectively at the level at which work really happens. ([Location 520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=520)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54386122) ^rw54386122
    - Date:: [[April 16th, 2020, Thursday]]
- Reflect for a moment on what it actually might be like if your personal management situation were totally under control, at all levels and at all times. What if you had completely clear mental space, with nothing pulling or pushing on you unproductively? ([Location 525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=525)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54386123) ^rw54386123

- If your mind is empty, it is always ready for anything; it is open for everything. —Shunryu Suzuki ([Location 559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=559)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54386127) ^rw54386127

    - Date:: [[April 16th, 2020, Thursday]]
- Most people have lived in a semistressful experience so consistently, for so long, they don’t know that it could be quite different—that there is another and more positive place from which to engage with their world. ([Location 565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=565)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54386129) ^rw54386129
    - Date:: [[April 16th, 2020, Thursday]]
- most stress they experience comes from inappropriately managed commitments they make or accept. ([Location 569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=569)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54386130) ^rw54386130
    - Date:: [[April 16th, 2020, Thursday]]
- You’ve probably made many more agreements with yourself than you realize, and every single one of them—big or little—is being tracked by a less-than-conscious part of you. These are the “incompletes,” or “open loops,” which I define as anything pulling at your attention that doesn’t belong where it is, the way it is. Open loops can include everything from really big to-do items like “End world hunger” to the more modest “Hire new assistant” to the tiniest task such as “Replace porch lightbulb.” ([Location 571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=571)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54386131) ^rw54386131
    - Date:: [[April 16th, 2020, Thursday]]
- Anything that does not belong where it is, the way it is, is an “open loop,” which will be pulling on your attention if it’s not appropriately managed. ([Location 575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=575)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54386132) ^rw54386132
    - Date:: [[April 16th, 2020, Thursday]]
- In order to deal effectively with all of that, you must first identify and capture all those things that are “ringing your bell” in some way, clarify what, exactly, they mean to you, and then make a decision about how to move on them. That may seem like a simple process, but in reality most people don’t do it in a consistent way. ([Location 577](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=577)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54386133) ^rw54386133

- Managing commitments well requires the implementation of some basic activities and behaviors: ([Location 581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=581)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54386134) ^rw54386134
    - Date:: [[April 16th, 2020, Thursday]]
- First of all, if it’s on your mind, your mind isn’t clear. Anything you consider unfinished in any way must be captured in a trusted system outside your mind, or what I call a collection tool, that you know you’ll come back to regularly and sort through. ([Location 582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=582)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54386135) ^rw54386135

- Second, you must clarify exactly what your commitment is and decide what you have to do, if anything, to make progress toward fulfilling it. ([Location 584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=584)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54386136) ^rw54386136

- Third, once you’ve decided on all the actions you need to take, you must keep reminders of them organized in a system you review regularly. ([Location 585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=585)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54386137) ^rw54386137

Your automatic mechanism then supplies the means whereby. —Maxwell Maltz ([Location 1499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=1499)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54386389) ^rw54386389

Whenever you feel strongly about events or ideas you must try not to let them pass from your mind, but instead to formulate them for your files and in so doing draw out their implications, show yourself how foolish these feelings or ideas are, or how they might be articulated into productive shape. —C.

- THE PURPOSE OF this whole method of workflow management is not to let your brain become lax, but rather to enable it to be free to experience more elegant, productive, and creative activity. In order to earn that freedom, however, your brain must engage on some consistent basis with all your commitments and activities. You must be assured that you’re doing what you need to be doing, and that it’s OK to be not doing what you’re not doing. That facilitates the condition of being present, which is always the optimal state from which to operate. Reviewing your system on a regular basis, reflecting on the contents, and keeping it current and functional are prerequisites for that kind of clarity and stability.

- After you review all your day- and time-specific commitments and handle whatever you need to about them, your next most frequent area for review will be the lists of all the actions you could possibly do in your current context. If you’re in your office, for instance, you’ll look at your lists of calls, computer actions, and in-office things to do. This doesn’t necessarily mean you will be doing anything on those lists; you’ll just evaluate them against the flow of other work coming at you to ensure that you make the best choices about what to deal with.

- Very simply, the Weekly Review is whatever you need to do to get your head empty again and get oriented for the next couple of weeks. It’s going through the steps of workflow management—capturing, clarifying, organizing, and reviewing all your outstanding commitments, intentions, and inclinations—until you can honestly say, “I absolutely know right now everything I’m not doing but could be doing if I decided to.” ([Location 3564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG9M2E&location=3564)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/61197328) ^rw61197328

- This methodology is not simply about cleaning up and getting closure. Those are critical factors, to be sure, to utilize for clarity and focus. Ultimately, though, the prime driver for my own exploration in this field has been creating the space to catalyze and access new, creative, and valuable thinking and direction. To a great extent, that’s actually not something you need to exert a lot of energy to achieve, if you have gotten this far in implementing this methodology. We are naturally creative beings, invested in our existence to live, grow, express, and expand. The challenge is not to be creative—it’s to eliminate the barriers to the natural flow of our creative energies. Practically speaking, it’s about getting your act together, letting spontaneous ideas emerge, capturing them, and utilizing their value. If you, in the process of reading and applying any of these techniques, have had any kind of “Aha! That reminds me . . .” or “Hmmm, I think I might want to . . . ,” because you externalized your thinking and reflected on it, then you’re already demonstrating the naturalness of this process.

- Another reason people consider unexpected demands or requests negative is because they don’t trust their own system and behaviors to be able to put a “bookmark” on any resulting action that needs to be taken, or on the work they’re doing at the moment. They know they need do something about the new work that just showed up, but they don’t trust that a simple note in their own in-tray will ensure it is handled with proper timing. So they stop their previous work and immediately go do what was just requested or required of them, complaining about the interruption that just disturbed their life. There are no interruptions, really—there are simply mismanaged occurrences.

- The healthiest approach for relaxed control and inspired productivity is to manage all the levels in a balanced fashion. At any of those levels, it’s critical to identify all the open loops, all the incompletions, and all the commitments that you have right now, as best you can. They all came, consciously or not, from the urges, pulls, and pushes from these multiple levels within you. Without an acceptance and an objective assessment of what’s true in the present, and feeling confident you can manage what you’ve created, it’s always difficult to cast off for new shores.

- I have learned over the years that the most important thing to deal with is whatever is most on your mind. The fact that you think it shouldn’t be on your mind is irrelevant. It’s there, and it’s there for a reason. “Buy cat food” may certainly not rank high on some theoretical prioritizing inventory, but if that’s what’s pulling on you the most, in the moment, then handling it in some way would be Job One. Once you handle what has your attention, it frees you up to notice what really has your attention. Which, when you handle that, will allow you to see what really has your attention, and so on. Almost without exception the executives I have worked with are most plagued by the management of the nitty-gritty of their workaday world—e-mails, meetings, travel, projects going off the rails, etc. When they begin to get all that under control, their attention invariably turns to areas of focus and interest from a higher perspective—family, career, and quality-of-life stuff. So don’t worry about what horizon or what content of your life is the highest priority to deal with—deal with what’s present. When you do, you will more effectively uncover and address what’s really true and meaningful for you.

- Horizon 2 This is the level of “current job responsibilities” and “areas of my life to maintain at an appropriate standard.” What are the hats you wear, the roles you play?

This is one of the most useful checklists you can create for your own self-management. It won’t require the kind of once-a-week recalibration that the Projects list will; more likely it will have meaning on a longer recursion cycle. Depending on the speed of change in some of the more important areas of your life and work, this should be used as a trigger for potential new projects every one to three months.

- Horizons 3–5 Whereas the three lower levels have mostly to do with the current state of things—your actions, projects, and areas of responsibility—from Horizon 3 up the factors of the future and your direction and intentions are primary. There is still an inventory to take at these plateaus (especially at the top level, purpose and principles, which represents an ongoing criterion for monitoring and correcting activities and behaviors), but it’s more about “What is true right now about where I’ve decided I’m going and how I’m going to get there?” This can range from one-year goals in your job (Horizon 3) to a three-year vision for your career and personal net worth (Horizon 4) to intuiting your life purpose and how to maximize its expression (Horizon 5).

- If the negative feelings come from broken agreements, you have three options for dealing with them and eliminating the negative consequences: Don’t make the agreement. Complete the agreement. Renegotiate the agreement. All of these can work to get rid of the unpleasant feelings.

- Suppose I’d told you I would meet you Thursday at four p.m., but after I made the appointment, my world changed. Now, given my new priorities, I decide I’m not going to meet you Thursday at four. But instead of simply not showing up, what had I better do, to maintain the integrity of the relationship? Correct—call and change the agreement. A renegotiated agreement is not a broken one.

- In my experience, anything that is held only in your head will take up either more or less attention than it deserves. The reason to collect everything is not that everything is equally important; it’s that it’s not. Incompletions, uncaptured, take on a dull sameness in the sense of the pressure they create and the attention they tie up.

- I suggest that you use your mind to think about things, rather than think of them. You want to be adding value as you think about projects and situations, not creating stress by simply reminding yourself they exist and you need to do something about them. To fully realize that more productive place, you will need to capture it all. It takes focus and a change of habit to train yourself to recognize and download even the smallest agreements with yourself as they’re created in your mind. Doing the capturing process as fully as you can, and then incorporating the behavior of gathering all the new things as they emerge, will be more empowering and productive than you can imagine.

- When a culture adopts “What’s the next action?” as a standard operating query, there’s an automatic increase in energy, productivity, clarity, and focus.

- I HAVE A personal mission to make “What’s the next action?” part of our global thought process. I envision a world in which no meeting or discussion will end, and no interaction cease, without a clear indication of whether or not some action is needed—and if it is, what it will be, or at least who has accountability for it. I envision organizations adopting a standard that anything that lands in anyone’s field of awareness will be evaluated for action required, and the resulting decisions managed appropriately. Imagine the freedom that would provide for people and organizations to focus their attention on bigger issues and opportunities.

- An idealist believes that the short run doesn’t count. A cynic believes the long run doesn’t matter. A realist believes that what is done or left undone in the short run determines the long run. —Sydney J.

- Challenging the purpose of anything you may be doing is healthy and mature. Being comfortable making up visions of success, before the methods are clear, is a phenomenal trait to strengthen. Being willing to have ideas, good or bad, and to express and capture all of them without judgment is critical for fully accessing creative intelligence. Honing multiple ideas and types of information into components, sequences, and priorities aimed toward a specific outcome is a necessary mental discipline. And deciding on and taking real next actions—actually moving on something in the physical world—is the essence of productivity.

- Being able to bring all these ingredients together, with appropriate timing and balance, is perhaps the major component of competence for this new millennium. But it’s not yet the norm of much professional and personal behavior; far from it. It’s still a daunting task to apply this awareness to all the aspects of one’s life. The natural planning model is natural, but in many cases it is not automatic.
