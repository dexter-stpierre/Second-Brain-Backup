- No animal in England is free. The life of an animal is misery and slavery: that is the plain truth. ([Location 189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ZX868W&location=189)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54387690) ^rw54387690

- “But is this simply part of the order of nature? Is it because this land of ours is so poor that it cannot afford a decent life to those who dwell upon it? No, ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ZX868W&location=190)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54387691) ^rw54387691

- There, comrades, is the answer to all our problems. It is summed up in a single word—Man. Man is the only real enemy we have. Remove Man from the scene, and the root cause of hunger and overwork is abolished for ever.

- Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend. And remember also that in fighting against Man, we must not come to resemble him.

- Even when you have conquered him, do not adopt his vices. No animal must ever live in a house, or sleep in a bed, or wear clothes, or drink alcohol, or smoke tobacco, or touch money, or engage in trade. All the habits of Man are evil. And, above all, no animal must ever tyrannise over his own kind.
