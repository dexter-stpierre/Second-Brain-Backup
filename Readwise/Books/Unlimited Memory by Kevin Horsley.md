- The great breakthrough in your life comes when you realize that you can learn anything you need to learn to accomplish any goal that you set for yourself. This means there are no limits on what you can be, have, or do. —Brian Tracy ([Location 47](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I3QS1XQ&location=47)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/84584657) ^rw84584657

- These systems require you to think differently than you’re used to. Many people want to improve their memory and concentration, but they continue to use outdated methods they already know, so they don’t get results. You have to do something different to become different.

- If I asked, “Who are you?” you would immediately start to rearrange memories in your mind to answer the question. You are a data-collecting being, and memory is where your life is lived. If you didn’t have a memory, you wouldn’t be able to learn, think, create, or even tie your shoes. You wouldn’t be able to build experience in any field—because experience is just a collection of memories! Only if you can remember information can you live it.

- Too often, we recognize and understand information when we hear it or read it, but can’t recall that information when we need it. For example, how many jokes do you know? You’ve probably heard thousands, but you can only recall about four or five right now. There is a big difference between remembering your four jokes and recognizing or understanding thousands. Understanding doesn’t create use: Only when you can instantly recall what you have understood, and practice using your remembered understanding, do you achieve mastery.

- Not storing information in your mind is expensive and can lead to embarrassment and poor judgment. If you must continually refer to notes or manuals to do your work, you will waste time and look unprofessional. Would you allow a doctor to operate on you if she had to continually refer to a manual or an iPad? Definitely not! Memory means storing what you have learned so you can use it later; otherwise, why would we bother learning in the first place?

- Learning and memory are the two most magical properties of the human mind. Learning is the ability to acquire new information, and memory holds that information in place over time. Memory is the foundation of all learning. The problem is that many people are not utilizing their memories to their full potential and so cannot recall information they have “learned”; they are constantly learning and forgetting, learning and forgetting, learning and forgetting … ([Location 76](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I3QS1XQ&location=76)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/84755196) ^rw84755196

- When you improve your memory, you improve everything. When you can access information more quickly and easily, you can create greater opportunities for connections and associations, and that makes it even easier to learn and remember new things in the future. An increased memory also enhances basic intelligence, because intelligence is based on all of the events, people, and facts that you can recall. The more you remember, the more you can do, because factual knowledge always precedes skill. Information can only be built onto more information, so the more you know, the easier it is to know more.

- This book is divided into three sections covering the four keys (or “Cs”) to improving your memory. The first section talks about improving your Concentration. The second section is about improving your ability to Create imagery and Connect concepts, and the final key is about creating a habit with Continuous use. The four Cs are the solution to any memory problem that you have or will face in the future. Some of the examples that I have used to demonstrate these concepts come from personal development and business books, so not only will you learn to improve your memory, you will also learn some key concepts that you can use for your personal development.

- I will teach you to transform bland information into something that is real and well-organized. This, in turn, gives the information meaning so you will use it instead of discard it. This is not rote learning, but a different way to store information that produces far better results. The goal is to improve learning and understanding.

- Before we begin, what excuses will you make for not reading this whole book? If you decide to read the whole book, what excuses will you make for not using the information that you will learn? I know you don’t yet know what you will be learning, but you have those excuses all lined up, don’t you? Take time to really think about your excuses and write them down.

- These are the same excuses that you always use to stop yourself from learning something new. You can have success or excuses, but you can’t have them both. People that learn quickly focus only on the information and skills that matter. Excuses don’t matter—they are “thought viruses.” ([Location 139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I3QS1XQ&location=139)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/84755205) ^rw84755205

- Every excuse you accept makes you weaker. Excuses stop you from concentrating and paying attention. When you excuse yourself from learning something new, you block your focus and your energy.

- If you continue to repeat negative thoughts like these, you will inevitably come to believe them.

- Richard Bach said, “Argue for your limitations and sure enough, they’re yours.” The only cause for not doing something with the information in this book is you, and nobody else but you. You are responsible for your learning. The person that has the most to do with what happens to you is you! If you believe your limits, your life will be very limited.

- Improving your memory and concentration is not only about what you need to do more of; it is also about what you need to do less of. It is amazing how quickly you can learn a new skill when you decide to let go of your excuses, judgments, and complaints. If you consistently change your approach and increase your desire to learn this information, you will master it.

- The mind is the limit. As long as the mind can envision the fact that you can do something, you can do it—as long as you believe 100 percent. — Arnold Schwarzenegger ([Location 178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I3QS1XQ&location=178)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/84755214) ^rw84755214

- Your beliefs about what your concentration and memory can do may be your own limited version of the truth. Many people never get a taste of their true potential because they have decided to entertain only a limited view of what they can do.

- Your limiting beliefs will keep you trapped in a loop. Your mind will continue to prevent you from learning anything new. Your beliefs either move you or stop you. Every thought and every word works for you or against you, and every thought that you confirm to be true becomes a belief. When you change a belief, you change a mental construction and, therefore, your life.

- First, remember that 80 percent of changing anything is about why you want to change and only 20 percent is about how you do it. It is as simple as having a reason and deciding that you want to change your beliefs. Take responsibility.

- Second, question the belief. There are some things that you previously believed with all your heart but now you don’t believe them. Why? Because you questioned them. If, long ago, some teacher told you that you have a memory like a sieve, it doesn’t mean you have to make the teacher’s words a reality. You were younger then, had less experience, and did not have the ability to question authority. Now you can question his or her judgment of your younger self. Ask yourself questions like, “How much is this belief going to cost me if I hold on to it? Do I have to hold on to it? Is it true? Can I be 100 percent certain that it is the truth?” ([Location 229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I3QS1XQ&location=229)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/84876902) ^rw84876902

- Concentration is made up of many small choices practiced consistently. The people that limit their attention are still using the your-brain-can’t-change model. Yet research tells us that the brain changes when we learn something new. We know that concentration can and should be improved.

- Most of us pay half-hearted attention to almost everything we do. We live in an activity illusion and think that “busyness” is equal to good business, but it’s often just procrastination in disguise. Busyness may make you feel good and make you think you are productive, but if you look back at the end of the day, you’ll realize you haven’t done anything worthwhile. We’ve trained our minds to have continuous partial, fragmented attention.

- Stop overwhelming yourself by continually changing the channels of your mind. Sharpen your intellect by making it a habit to do one thing at a time. Rediscover the value of consecutive tasking, instead of settling for the diluted quality that comes from simultaneous tasking. Exceptional work is always associated with periods of deep concentration. Nothing excellent ever comes from a scattered effort. When you are “all there,” your brain power and resources will be all there, too.

- Purpose: A clear purpose is important because clarity dissolves resistance. Always remember why you are reading or learning the information. Keep your purpose at the forefront of your mind. If you don’t know what you want, how are you going to know when you get it? Learning with a purpose increases your attention, comprehension, and retention; it also helps organize your thoughts.

- You don’t worry because you care; you worry because that is what you have learned to do. Worry is a creative mental process. By asking yourself “what if” questions, you set your mind up to worry. If you consistently ask, “What if I lose my job?” “What if I crash my car?” “What if criminals attack me?” then you will create “movies” in your mind that constantly loop those scenarios and cultivate a state of worry.

- Your mind is like an internal movie screen on which you can produce information. This is how we think and learn effectively. Your brain creates miracles every day by converting lifeless information into pictures and ideas. When you become aware of this, every word becomes a picture drawn with letters, because words are symbols of three-dimensional images. Arthur Gordon said, “Isn’t it amazing how we take them for granted? Those little black marks on paper. Twenty-six different shapes known as letters, arranged in endless combinations, known as words, lifeless, until someone’s eye falls on them.” ([Location 393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I3QS1XQ&location=393)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85063069) ^rw85063069
