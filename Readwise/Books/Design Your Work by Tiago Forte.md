## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- I have to write to know what I think. All my ideas sound brilliant in the echo chamber of my own mind. It is only when I put down my thoughts, letting them stand on their own strength, that I start to see the cracks and imperfections. ([Location 58](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=58)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54387180) ^rw54387180
    - Date:: [[March 2nd, 2020, Monday]]
- It actually goes beyond this – I have to write to think. Otherwise the same old ideas keep circulating round and round, clogging the synapses. Writing is not a result of thinking – it is thinking itself, scaffolded by the external props of a keyboard and screen.

- The title Design Your Work refers to the overall theme tying together these essays: the idea that one can design their own work. ([Location 72](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=72)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54387182) ^rw54387182

- The capacity to perform work — to shape the world and make our ideas manifest — is among the highest privileges of being human. Any capability so powerful is worth thinking deeply about.

- It isn’t obvious at first, but work can provide opportunities for nearly every aspect of personal growth: learning, perspective, self-expression, self-affirmation, status and prestige, self-sufficiency, self-discovery, and making a positive impact on the world.

    - Date:: [[March 2nd, 2020, Monday]]
- If we want to free up time and energy to pursue what matters to us, it’s a good idea to start by streamlining the boring but necessary activities we have to do to get by. ([Location 119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=119)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54387198) ^rw54387198

    - Date:: [[March 2nd, 2020, Monday]]
- This requires, first and foremost, showing people that they are designers, by nature if not by profession. Next, it requires teaching them how to design their own methods, for their own circumstances and their own needs.

    - Date:: [[March 2nd, 2020, Monday]]
- I found I could intensify my attention by focusing on a tiny spot — like the spot just behind my ear — and when I expanded my focus, the sensations would burst outward. ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=246)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54387219) ^rw54387219

    - Date:: [[March 2nd, 2020, Monday]]
- I felt a newfound desire to connect with people, and not just to impress them or get something from them. Speaking with a young man who told me he lived out of his car, I was surprised to feel no reaction in my mind — no aversion, no pity, no feeling of superiority followed quickly by shame; only a subtle feeling of compassion and curiosity. ([Location 273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=273)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54387222) ^rw54387222
    - Date:: [[March 2nd, 2020, Monday]]
- Gaps of time I had found unbearably boring and quickly filled by fiddling with my phone — waiting for the train to arrive, waiting at the doctor’s office, waiting in checkout lines — suddenly became precious moments of calm, allowing me to stop and reflect on what I was doing and feeling.

- Lastly, and I hesitate to mention it because it is such a cliché, I was happy. Happier than I could remember, more so than after any achievement or vacation.

    - Date:: [[March 2nd, 2020, Monday]]
- I knew that this happiness was different than any I’d felt before. It had nothing to do with a particular set of circumstances. It set no conditions or criteria. Making no demands on the world, the world couldn’t shake it. Accepting the bad along with the good, it stripped the bad of its power. ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=280)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54387225) ^rw54387225
    - Date:: [[March 2nd, 2020, Monday]]
- Sitting in a dark room for 10 days and peeling away layer after layer of my perception, I had discovered first-hand a truth that seems both obvious and far too good to be true: that the default state of the human mind is happiness. This is why happiness is not an achievement to be attained — every single thing you add merely obscures what is already there.

    - Date:: [[March 2nd, 2020, Monday]]
- We assume that if we are simultaneously looking at, listening to, and thinking about someone, then we must be paying them our “full attention.” This couldn’t be further from the truth.

    - Date:: [[March 2nd, 2020, Monday]]
- Every time you respond to a distraction — a new email in your inbox, a notification on your phone, a red badge on an app — you are training your mind to value the new at the expense of the important.

- But what if depriving pain of much of its power was as simple as paying attention to it? Anger, doubt, shame, envy, vengeance — all these feelings have such a hold over us only because they operate in the dark. Shine a light on them, and they wither.

- “The opposite of every great truth is also true.” But with an asterisk: as long as you know thyself well enough to understand how it is true for you. An ounce of self-knowledge is worth a ton of productivity advice, in this respect, because it starts to reveal this mirror-image landscape of performance.

- The catch, of course, is that you can’t proceed directly to self-knowledge. It may be stored in the form of abstract principles, but you still need the individual lessons.

- If “meta-learning” is learning how to learn, then meta-skills in this context involve “learning how to work.” Meta-skills are the skills you need to leverage other skills.

- If meta-skills are the tools of survival, helping you stay alive long enough to find shelter, food, and water, then macro-laws are the map you’ll need to find your way to more interesting places.

- Sometimes these macro-laws take the form of simple rules of thumb: “I’m more productive in the morning” or “I prefer a distraction-free environment.” ([Location 3315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=3315)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54387676) ^rw54387676

- But the most consequential ones shape the future of one’s career and life, painting possible choices in broad strokes: “I’m more right-brained than left-brained.” “I need a job that is predictable, where I can control things.” ([Location 3317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=3317)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54387677) ^rw54387677

- The most extensive and explicit example of personal macro-laws I know of is Buster Benson’s wonderful Book of Beliefs. He lists his metabeliefs, perceptions, opinions, and predictions in the form of an annually updated, open-source Github repository.

- The example beliefs I listed above may seem trivial, but dealing in such constraints is playing with fire. Because there is very little, and perhaps no difference, between a genuine nugget of self-knowledge and what’s known as a “limiting belief.” ([Location 3323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=3323)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54387679) ^rw54387679

- A constraint that in one situation saves you from risk, in another situation limits your possibilities. This is why the skill of constantly formulating, discarding, testing, and refining macro-laws may be the most “meta” productivity skill of all.

- self-discovery is more than simply accumulating accurate descriptive facts about oneself. The goal is to define the direction of further study by “picking out a range of situations that occur frequently or involve possibilities that lever the system onto new paths.” ([Location 3335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=3335)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54387681) ^rw54387681

- it takes creativity, intuition, and deep self-knowledge to formulate new macro-laws about ourselves that both fit our past and current identity, and simultaneously guide our future in interesting directions.

- it is deep immersion in the messy details of experiments, contending in hand-to-hand combat with the subtleties and ambiguities and exceptions unique to each one, that produces the best breakthroughs.

- The paper Statistical Inference for Individual Organism Research: Mixed Blessing or Curse? argues that the introduction of inferential statistics into the field of experimental psychology in the 1970’s not only failed to produce breakthroughs (as one might expect), but actually held the field back. The explanation offered is that, in the “old days,” researchers had to create experimental controls — finely tuned counterbalances to independent variables. This process, while tedious and time-consuming, produced great insights: The prolonged and intense interaction with the subject matter undertaken in order to experimentally control irrelevant sources of variation probably constituted a rich source of ideas for further experimentation.

- What qualifies as “better experimentation” when it comes to human behavior is whatever enhances this tip-of-the-fingers intuition, not whatever happens to lend itself to easier measurement.

- Meta-skills are constraints on how you work, to better leverage your knowledge, intelligence, time, people, and other resources. Macro-laws are constraints on what you work on, limiting your search space to a direction most likely to be fruitful.

- We tend to assume that increasing complexity must mean “adding more and more of something.” As bacteria become animals become humans (or data becomes information becomes knowledge), we look everywhere for that “something added.” ([Location 3427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075VXH7ZL&location=3427)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54387687) ^rw54387687

- Is there any better definition of productivity? We learn meta-skills to perform higher-leverage work, but the best source of leverage is creating new constraints — new macro-laws. These macro-laws channel our energy more efficiently, giving us the surplus resources to acquire yet more skills. Improving one’s productivity is not a self-organizing process, but a self-simplifying one.
