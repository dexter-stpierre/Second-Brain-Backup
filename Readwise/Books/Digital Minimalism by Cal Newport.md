- “An endless bombardment of news and gossip and images has rendered us manic information addicts. It broke me. It might break you, too.” ([Location 47](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=47)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54387845) ^rw54387845

- As many people clarified, the issue was the overall impact of having so many different shiny baubles pulling so insistently at their attention and manipulating their mood. Their problem with this frenzied activity is less about its details than the fact that it’s increasingly beyond their control. Few want to spend so much time online, but these tools have a way of cultivating behavioral addictions.

- whatever its source, this irresistible attraction to screens is leading people to feel as though they’re ceding more and more of their autonomy when it comes to deciding how they direct their attention.

- In an open marketplace for attention, darker emotions attract more eyeballs than positive and constructive thoughts. ([Location 80](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=80)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54387848) ^rw54387848

- repeated interaction with this darkness can become a source of draining negativity—a steep price that many don’t even realize they’re paying to support their compulsive connectivity.

- I began more seriously researching and writing on this topic, trying to both better understand its contours and seek out the rare examples of those who can extract great value from these new technologies without losing control.* ([Location 88](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=88)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54387850) ^rw54387850

- One of the first things that became clear during this exploration is that our culture’s relationship with these tools is complicated by the fact that they mix harm with benefits.

    - Date:: [[January 24th, 2020, Friday]]
- I’ve become convinced that what you need instead is a full-fledged philosophy of technology use, rooted in your deep values, that provides clear answers to the questions of what tools you should use and how you should use them and, equally important, enables you to confidently ignore everything else.

- Because digital minimalists spend so much less time connected than their peers, it’s easy to think of their lifestyle as extreme, but the minimalists would argue that this perception is backward: what’s extreme is how much time everyone else spends staring at their screens.

- We require a philosophy that puts our aspirations and values once again in charge of our daily experience, all the while dethroning primal whims and the business models of Silicon Valley from their current dominance of this role; a philosophy that accepts new technologies, but not if the price is the dehumanization Andrew Sullivan warned us about; a philosophy that prioritizes long-term meaning over short-term satisfaction.

    - Date:: [[January 24th, 2020, Friday]]
- The source of our unease is not evident in these thin-sliced case studies, but instead becomes visible only when confronting the thicker reality of how these technologies as a whole have managed to expand beyond the minor roles for which we initially adopted them.

- What’s making us uncomfortable, in other words, is this feeling of losing control—a feeling that instantiates itself in a dozen different ways each day, such as when we tune out with our phone during our child’s bath time, or lose our ability to enjoy a nice moment without a frantic urge to document it for a virtual audience.

    - Date:: [[January 24th, 2020, Friday]]
- Either way, the outcome is hard to predict, which, as the psychology of addiction teaches us, makes the whole activity of posting and checking maddeningly appealing.

- “Apps and websites sprinkle intermittent variable rewards all over their products because it’s good for business.” ([Location 344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=344)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54387883) ^rw54387883
    - Date:: [[January 24th, 2020, Friday]]
- The thought process that went into building these applications, Facebook being the first of them, . . . was all about: “How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?” And that means that we need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while, because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever.

    - Date:: [[January 24th, 2020, Friday]]
- The whole social media dynamic of posting content, and then watching feedback trickle back unpredictably, seems fundamental to these services, but as Tristan Harris points out, it’s actually just one arbitrary option among many for how they could operate. ([Location 354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=354)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54387885) ^rw54387885
    - Date:: [[January 24th, 2020, Friday]]
- Remember that early social media sites featured very little feedback—their operations focused instead on posting and finding information. It tends to be these early, pre-feedback-era features that people cite when explaining why social media is important to their life.

    - Date:: [[January 24th, 2020, Friday]]
- there’s nothing fundamental about the unpredictable feedback that dominates most social media services. If you took these features away, you probably wouldn’t diminish the value most people derive from them.

    - Date:: [[January 24th, 2020, Friday]]
- The other side of this evolutionary bargain, of course, is that a lack of positive feedback creates a sense of distress. This is serious business for the Paleolithic brain, and therefore it can develop an urgent need to continually monitor this “vital” information.

- A similar drive to regulate social approval helps explain the current obsession among teenagers to maintain Snapchat “streaks” with their friends, as a long unbroken streak of daily communication is a satisfying confirmation that the relationship is strong.

- Digital Minimalism A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else.

    - Date:: [[January 24th, 2020, Friday]]
- Notice, this minimalist philosophy contrasts starkly with the maximalist philosophy that most people deploy by default—a mind-set in which any potential for benefit is enough to start using a technology that catches your attention. A maximalist is very uncomfortable with the idea that anyone might miss out on something that’s the least bit interesting or valuable.

- Tyler, for example, originally joined the standard social media services for the standard reasons: to help his career, to keep him connected, and to provide entertainment. Once Tyler embraced digital minimalism, however, he realized that although he valued all three of these goals, his compulsive use of social networks offered at best minor benefits, and did not qualify as the best way to use technology for these purposes. So he quit all social media to pursue more direct and effective ways to help his career, connect with other people, and be entertained.

- For many, the core question of “is this the best way to use technology to support this value?” leads them to carefully optimize services that most people fiddle with mindlessly.

- Principle #1: Clutter is costly. Digital minimalists recognize that cluttering their time and attention with too many devices, apps, and services creates an overall negative cost that can swamp the small benefits that each individual item provides in isolation.

    - Date:: [[January 24th, 2020, Friday]]
- Principle #2: Optimization is important. Digital minimalists believe that deciding a particular technology supports something they value is only the first step. To truly extract its full potential benefit, it’s necessary to think carefully about how they’ll use the technology.

We attend to tone and nuance.” On the other hand: “When we communicate on our digital devices, we learn different habits.” ([Location 1739](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=1739)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54388021) ^rw54388021

- Many people think about conversation and connection as two different strategies for accomplishing the same goal of maintaining their social life. This mind-set believes that there are many different ways to tend important relationships in your life, and in our current modern moment, you should use all tools available—spanning from old-fashioned face-to-face talking, to tapping the heart icon on a friend’s Instagram post. The philosophy of conversation-centric communication takes a harder stance. It argues that conversation is the only form of interaction that in some sense counts toward maintaining a relationship.
