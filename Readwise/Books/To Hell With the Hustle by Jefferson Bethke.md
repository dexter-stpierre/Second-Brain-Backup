- After only a decade or two of living up to these cultural expectations, many of us turn around and realize we can’t find the meaning we thought we were striving for. We’ve been hustling, but hustling toward an empty grave. Lifeless. Less human. Because we’re busier. More frantic. More disconnected. Lonelier.

- But what if hustle is actually what got us to this point?1 What if it’s not the solution, but the problem? What if hustle is a contagion that is flowing through our veins in subtle, under-the-surface ways?

- A recent Gallup poll concluded that very thing: “Like all employees, millennials care about their income. But for this generation, a job is about more than a paycheck—it’s about a purpose.”4 ([Location 264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QND4MX2&location=264)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54386666) ^rw54386666

- As Anne Petersen noted in her brilliant, recent piece titled “How Millennials Became the Burnout Generation,” we think we “need to find employment that reflects well on our parents . . . that’s also impressive to our peers,” and that fulfills us.7 But, Petersen continued, the problem with thinking “Your dream job is out there, so never stop hustling—is that it’s a blueprint for spiritual and physical exhaustion.” ([Location 281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QND4MX2&location=281)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54386668) ^rw54386668

And whether we realize it or not, our telos is our most primal defining feature. We will bend and break an entire life around what we believe our telos to be.

- For too long we’ve confused legalism with something that takes effort or discipline. Just because we do something over and over doesn’t mean it’s legalistic.

- Once we realize that our daily habits are forming us on a fundamental level (and even more once they become micro rituals, which are the things we do every day without really realizing them), then we will start paying attention. We begin to ask, are these doing something to me I don’t particularly like or want but don’t realize?

- We’ve created an assembly-line Christianity. Instead of investing in relationships and one-on-one interactions with other people, we just bring our friends to church and place them on the conveyor belt of the “Sunday service,” where in ninety minutes they can get a good spiritual feeling, sing some songs, hear an encouraging message, get a coffee, and then hear the pastor tell them that if they want to follow Jesus to “pray this prayer.” ([Location 779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QND4MX2&location=779)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/54386702) ^rw54386702

Or here’s a better way to put it: we shouldn’t be seeking out those moments, but instead living our lives in the holiness of the ordinary. And if God wants to get our attention with something big, we can trust that he will.
