- The case for GTD-style task management using @RoamResearch 1/ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rjnestor/status/1255298972865921027)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/55431528) ^rw55431528

- I've used Todoist, happily, for almost 6 years. 46,662 completed tasks later, I moved my task management into a custom-built system in @RoamResearch (complete with #@next, #@waiting, and all the requisite GTD labels). 2/ [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/55431529) ^rw55431529

- Why would I do that? Todoist is structured for tasks. Roam isn't, other than a general [[TODO]] page where every unfinished task is referenced. What benefits made this long-time Todoist user build a system in Roam from scratch? Other than my general nerdy-ness, that is... 3/ [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/55431530) ^rw55431530

- First: Tasks can have deep integration with relevant notes. For example, I've also rebuilt my CRM in @RoamResearch. Contact & relationship info is immediately available that, in Todoist, would (at best) be buried in comments or linked from another app. 4/ [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/55431531) ^rw55431531

- Second: Tasks can be created anywhere, inline with my notes and ideas, then show up where I need them based on tags. I don't need to bounce from my creative flow to a dedicated to-do app. I just create a task, tag it #Inbox (or whatever), and keep writing. 5/ [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/55431532) ^rw55431532

- Third: Tasks can given attributes for "do:" and "due:" dates, and (if they're created on a Daily Notes page) they come ready-made with a "date created" tag. This ensures they'll easily show up on relevant important dates. (Note: Todoist doesn't do both "do" and "due" dates.) 6/ [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/55431533) ^rw55431533

- Fourth: Using queries, I can build pages that replace Todoist's filters. My #@next page, for example doesn't only rely on references and filters. I built "Next Office, "Next Home," "Next Contact," etc., queries that give me exactly what I need in the right contexts. 7/ [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/55431534) ^rw55431534

- Fifth: It's easy to embed task blocks. This lets me, during my morning review, plan out #@next actions non-destructivelyâ€”tasks still live where they were created, but every element of them is available where I need it to be. 8/ [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/55431535) ^rw55431535

- One major drawback: @RoamResearch doesn't support recurring tasks. Honestly, I don't know if it ever WILL, given that it's not a task manager first and foremost. I've found a way to make this work that, while somewhat "manual" in nature, is highly functional for me. 9/ [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/55431536) ^rw55431536

- I have dedicated pages for my [[Daily List]], [[Weekly Tasks]], [[Monthly Tasks]], and [[Annual Tasks]]. Once a week, I gather weekly, monthly, and annual pages in the sidebar and prep the next week's dates with the appropriate tasks. 10/ [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/55431537) ^rw55431537

- Shoutout to @RosieCampbell and her "Daily Template workflow" for that inspiration (https://t.co/74Uk2XXalV)! This method takes maybe 20 mins a week, but keeps me intimately connected to the important recurring tasks coming up. 11/ [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/55431538) ^rw55431538

- In six weeks, @RoamResearch has revolutionized not just the way I write and the way I think, but also the way I interact with the world. Without leaving Roam, I can organize and document every aspect of my day, without feeling tied down in any way. I just write. 12/ [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/55431539) ^rw55431539

- I admit, this task management method isn't for everyone. You have to be diligent with your tagging and your review (though I would argue those are good habits to form anyway!). If anyone is interested to see how I set it up, DM me. Talking about @RoamResearch makes me giddy! 13/ [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/55431540) ^rw55431540
