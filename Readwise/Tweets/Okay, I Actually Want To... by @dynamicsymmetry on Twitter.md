- Okay, I actually want to talk about this for a second, regarding millennials and how really goddamn difficult it is for us to make sense of our own age sometimes. https://t.co/1ZdWibw9w8 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dynamicsymmetry/status/1046873895494664192)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/239311768) ^rw239311768

- I haven‚Äôt done, like, a Sociology about this, but I strongly suspect that a significant percentage of us are struggling with the fact that many of the benchmarks for different stages of adulthood that we grew up with no longer apply to us, and it‚Äôs causing us to feel unmoored.

- Adults are supposed to get married. A lot of us aren‚Äôt getting married. Adults are supposed to have kids. A lot of us aren‚Äôt doing that. Adults are supposed to get past college and get a Real Job. A lot of us aren‚Äôt doing that.

- Adults are supposed to stop playing with toys, or at least to switch to different toys, like tools and cars and boats. And. Well. Uh. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dynamicsymmetry/status/1046875169548066817)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/239311771) ^rw239311771

- Add to that the fact that we literally don‚Äôt experience time the way we used to. Time is both stretched and collapsed, especially right now. Years feel like months. Weeks feel like years. The past is smashed into the future which folds into the present.

- Yeah, THIS. What even *is* a ‚Äújob‚Äù anymore? What the hell is a ‚Äúcareer‚Äù? How does one get those?
  We‚Äôre a generation of underpaid and unpaid labor. https://t.co/Rlc7mnXtr9 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dynamicsymmetry/status/1046875966449041413)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/239311773) ^rw239311773

- Labor and its stability and the identity it gives you is one of the ways we were always supposed to know we were GROWN THE HELL UP. Where is that for us? Some of us have it, but it does not define our adulthood the way it did for our parents.

- I was having tea with @phippsdontlie last year and talking about all this stuff I buy and wear, and wondering if there was an age when I wasn‚Äôt allowed to have it anymore. Is there an age when I can no longer wear skinny jeans? But I *like* skinny jeans.

- And please spare me ‚ÄúYOU‚ÄôRE ONLY AS OLD AS YOU FEEL‚Äù and ‚ÄúWEAR WHATEVER YOU WANT‚Äù, because my dude, that is useless and entirely beside my point. 
  My point is that I don‚Äôt know what adult means. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dynamicsymmetry/status/1046876754181279744)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/239311776) ^rw239311776

- I‚Äôm looking around for clothes, for *anything* that is a cultural benchmark of what it means to be 40 year old Sunny and 50 year old Sunny and I swear to God I have absolutely nothing, I don‚Äôt know what that looks like.

- One of the things this means is that a lot of Millennials feel stuck in arrested development, and you see the reinforcement of our infantilization through the thinkpieces about us.

- People write about us like we‚Äôre still barely in college, when a lot of us are entering our mid and even late thirties. *A lot of us are close to forty goddamn years old.* 
  You see? The world itself doesn‚Äôt know how old we are. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dynamicsymmetry/status/1046877592983343104)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/239311779) ^rw239311779

- But something else that happens - and I notice this so keenly in myself these days - is a sense of panic, that we‚Äôre getting older and running out of time and *we haven‚Äôt even grown the fuck up yet*. 
  Think about that for a second. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dynamicsymmetry/status/1046877911662374912)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/239311780) ^rw239311780

- We‚Äôre not complaining about how we‚Äôre getting old, or at least I‚Äôm not. That‚Äôs not what makes my stomach quivery. It‚Äôs the sense that the world is speeding up and speeding up and I‚Äôm running out of time and I don‚Äôt own a house and I don‚Äôt have kids and oh my god what the fuck ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dynamicsymmetry/status/1046878236116996098)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/239311781) ^rw239311781

- We‚Äôre not in a mid-life crisis. Millennials are experiencing a *goddamn crisis of temporality*. We don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôre old. We don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôre young. We don‚Äôt know what we‚Äôre doing. We‚Äôve lost our guideposts, our benchmarks, our rubrics for life. 
  And people blame us for it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dynamicsymmetry/status/1046878827593523200)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/239311782) ^rw239311782

- And it really doesn‚Äôt help that we‚Äôre approaching middle age (WHATEVER THAT EVEN MEANS ANYMORE) in an deeply toxic economic system, with a global future currently very much in doubt, and our parents won‚Äôt stop fucking us over.

- So the next time you hear a Millennial in their thirties complaining about feeling old, maybe listen to the words behind the words. Because we are living through some shit. 
  Also our knees and backs hurt and we don‚Äôt have health insurance. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dynamicsymmetry/status/1046879509490884610)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/239311784) ^rw239311784

- Also there‚Äôs a very real prospect that many of us won‚Äôt be able to afford to retire. We‚Äôre not the only generation facing that, or the only generation that‚Äôs ever faced that, but you need to understand that we‚Äôre facing that in the context of having been lied to.

- Oh, and please don‚Äôt respond to this with ‚Äúother people have gone through this too‚Äù because 
  A) I know, I do social-historical academic work
  B) Every generation experiences similar trends in different ways and we are experiencing *radical* differences from what our parents did. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dynamicsymmetry/status/1046881831088508928)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/239311786) ^rw239311786

- Oh, and additional caveat: I‚Äôm not even beginning to get into race and class here because this is a twitter thread not an academic paper and I don‚Äôt feel equipped right now to give that the attention it deserves; just be aware that I know I‚Äôm oversimplifying a lot here.

  Give me money if you want I guess but even more
  - give to your local food bank if you can
