## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- Time for a thread on the Reichstag fire and how the Nazis used it to consolidate power and eliminate all civil rights in Germany. The Reichstag burned 27 Feb 1933. Hitler, Goering and Frick seized on this to create their dream of a police state. https://t.co/3btGv21tdm
