- This guy has all of this “sympathy” for a racist that has been harassing my wife for a week. “What if the racist kills himself?”, before “what if this constant harassment cause Angie to harm herself?”.
  This is the appeasement or racism which I feel is worst than racism. https://t.co/5d9StO4O3Z ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Johnny_J_Jones/status/1266784429092962304)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/352369809) ^rw352369809
