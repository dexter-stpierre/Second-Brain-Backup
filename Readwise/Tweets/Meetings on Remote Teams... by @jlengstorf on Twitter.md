## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- meetings on remote teams are hard. we get caught between two conflicting feelings:
  1. “I don’t like meetings”
  2. “I feel disconnected from my team”
  I’m increasingly convinced that many (most?) remote teams are having on the wrong kind of meetings
  (a meetings thread, I guess)

- the old joke is that “this meeting could have been a Slack message”
  for remote teams, the default meeting I see is a check-in / status call — which should absolutely be a Slack message
  writing a list of updates & taking turns reading them to our coworkers is a terrible meeting ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf/status/1433815605644201984)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/223308352) ^rw223308352

- I’ve seen teams move status updates async. a few even moved to zero meetings
  but a new problem surfaces: a sense of disconnection 
  even the grumpiest of us needs social connection. we need teammates, not colleagues we barely know & don’t speak to ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf/status/1433815606562721797)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/223308353) ^rw223308353

- in an office setting there are forcing functions to create social connection:
  - we eat lunch together
  - we chat as we walk down a hall or take an elevator together
  - we make small talk with our nearby office mates
  our proximity to our coworkers naturally creates social moments ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf/status/1433815607443554309)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/223308354) ^rw223308354

- remotely, none of that happens automatically. for individual contributors, it’s entirely possible to go through multiple days of work without any synchronous human interaction
  that can be incredible for short, focused bursts
  but long term it leads to loneliness & disconnection ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf/status/1433815608420831233)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/223308355) ^rw223308355

- I spent a year on a contract where I was on the other side of the planet from my collaborators. we had no overlap and almost never spoke
  I loved the no-meetings at first
  then I spiraled into a full-blown existential crisis ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf/status/1433815609322598406)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/223308356) ^rw223308356

- what was the point? I sit here and move dots in a box alone for 8 hours a day in silence? does anyone care what I’m doing? does any of it matter AT ALL?
  that tailspin took me a while to pull out of and led to me seeking out an in-person job for my next role ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf/status/1433815610320842752)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/223308357) ^rw223308357

- humans — even the super introverted ones — need *some* social connection with our teammates
  without lunches and hallways and elevators, meetings are all we have left. but that means the meetings have to be SOCIAL ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf/status/1433815611361021963)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/223308358) ^rw223308358

- if you join a meeting with Netlify’s Developer Experience team, you might initially think we waste a lot of time. 5–10 minutes (or more) at the beginning of most of our meetings is spent trying to make each other laugh, telling stories, and making fun of @philhawksworth ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf/status/1433815612413800451)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/223308359) ^rw223308359

- I haven’t met @kenny_io or @bencodezen or @cassidoo in person, but we have inside jokes and we’ve been vulnerable with each other and I’d go to battle for them and I trust them to make decisions on my behalf
  goofing around at the beginning of meetings got us to this point ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf/status/1433815615031037956)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/223308360) ^rw223308360

- work is not family, but it IS community — as remote workers, we have to make space to create a tight-knit community
  and read-only status meetings won’t get us there ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf/status/1433815615928631296)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/223308361) ^rw223308361

- to avoid feeling isolated and disconnected at work, here are a few unsolicited remote meeting tips:
  1. at least once a week, have a meeting with your team that’s longer than it needs to be to do the critical thing (e.g. add 15 minutes for bullshitting at the beginning) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf/status/1433815616947818505)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/223308362) ^rw223308362
    - Date:: [[September 6th, 2021, Monday]]
- 2. cancel meetings that don’t require discussion — the value of a meeting is high-context exchange, so if there’s no intention to discuss, send a memo or Slack message instead ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf/status/1433815617832841220)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/223308363) ^rw223308363

- 3. if an async discussion goes beyond one or two quick questions or starts to get abstract, call a meeting
  nuances are hard async. a quick discussion usually makes things resolve faster AND helps you build a connection to your coworker(s) — working through ideas creates a bond ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf/status/1433815618797465601)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/223308364) ^rw223308364

- 4. invite quieter coworkers into discussions. don’t put them on the spot or call them out, but make sure to invite people who haven’t spoken to weigh in
  some coworkers need time and an invitation before they feel comfortable participating ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf/status/1433815619665727488)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/223308365) ^rw223308365

- (this is something I struggle with; I will fill space and not notice that someone got boxed out of a conversation) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf/status/1433815620550680577)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/223308366) ^rw223308366

- 5. don’t be afraid of short, ad hoc meetings. jump on a 5-minute call to ask one question. think of it like shoulder-tapping in the office ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf/status/1433815621364420611)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/223308368) ^rw223308368
    - Date:: [[September 6th, 2021, Monday]]
- 6. create hangout calls. drop a Zoom link into your team chat and cowork for a while. maybe play music. most of the time everyone is quiet, but occasionally a joke or question comes up ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf/status/1433815622140395523)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/223308370) ^rw223308370
    - Date:: [[September 6th, 2021, Monday]]
- 7. be patient and consistent. building community and connection takes time
  we need time to warm up to each other. we have to get a feel for our senses of humor and build trust. don’t give up if you have a couple awkward chat sessions at first ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf/status/1433815623063117826)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/223308372) ^rw223308372

- if you’re frustrated by the meetings on your team, look at what kind of meetings you’re having
  are you reading each other status updates?
  or are you having meaningful discussions and actually connecting with your coworkers?
