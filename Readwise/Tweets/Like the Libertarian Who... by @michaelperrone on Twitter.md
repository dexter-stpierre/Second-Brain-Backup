- Like the libertarian who insists "if we just got the State out of X" everything would be sunshine & rainbows, Dave Ramsey clings to a fantasy version of personal finance that doesn't work well IRL. https://t.co/5GwWvm56Fk ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/michaelperrone/status/1471940985240227843)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/264391869) ^rw264391869

- First, to follow Dave's baby steps is to not only miss out on massive gains & opportunities but to put your finances in danger. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/michaelperrone/status/1471940987052171267)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/268119602) ^rw268119602

- People forget that finance "pros" like Dave can and will only give you the general, play it safe advice. They'll never tell you to do the things they did to succeed bc that involves risk and faith.

- But by playing it safe, there is still risk, not the least of which is the risk of regret. 
  Dave would have you pay off all debt before you invest or buy a home or even save money. "It's not your money yet if you have debt."
  This sort tunnel vision can keep you poor. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/michaelperrone/status/1471940989849772033)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/268119605) ^rw268119605

- If I had followed Dave's advice, I would be trying to buy my house today for almost DOUBLE the price I paid for it in 2017. 
  That would mean tens of thousands more in cash up front and a payment 30% higher than what i have now. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/michaelperrone/status/1471940991120592896)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/268119606) ^rw268119606

- If I had followed Dave's advice I would have been paying down 3-5% interest loan balances instead of making 10%+ in the market. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/michaelperrone/status/1471940992404054016)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/268119608) ^rw268119608

- If I had followed Dave's advice, I would not have leveraged myself to achieve important goals and get out of Corporate America. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/michaelperrone/status/1471940993591042052)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/268119610) ^rw268119610

- If I had followed Dave's advice, I would be trying to pay off my mortgage early (which is easily the stupidest advice he still gives out) instead of buying an investment property. 
  @markallanbovair has a great thread on this

- Dave's advice worked better in a low inflation, high interest rate environment. In this sense, he's another boomer who doesn't realize that not everything is like it was when he was a kid.

- Contrary to Dave's advice, rich people don't typically get rich by saving money. They get rich by getting lots of money, usually from more than 1 source.
  Most of the personal finance gurus out there confuse these two, so Dave is not alone. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/michaelperrone/status/1471940997944799233)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/268119616) ^rw268119616

- For example, in the 90s a bank gave me about 5% interest on a savings account. I got a $1,000 inheritance from my grandpa at age 5. By the time I was 18 that money had nearly doubled.
  Now over the course of 13 years, current interest rates would earn you a $1.30. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/michaelperrone/status/1471940999190441992)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/268119618) ^rw268119618

- In 1983, my parents bought a nice 3 bedroom house for $65,000 & sold it 15 years later for $80,000. That house is now worth nearly $300,000.

- I'm w/Dave in that I wish frugality was more valued. But the practical value of frugality has never been lower, at any income level.
  Counting pennies is for a more tangible world, filled with ppl who make things. 
  When everything is consumed, money is faker than ever. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/michaelperrone/status/1471941001526734850)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/268119622) ^rw268119622

- There are other things to nitpick Dave Ramsey on like the "debt snowball" method or the right size of an emergency fund. But I'll let the personal finance nerds do that. 
  A lot of money is just personal preference. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/michaelperrone/status/1471941002785013760)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/268119624) ^rw268119624

- And it may only bother me, but Dave backs up most of his advice with cringeworthy biblical literacy. 
  As if a parable about the heavy spiritual costs of Discipleship has anything to say about budgeting. 
  It's a way of dumbing down scripture and missing the real meaning. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/michaelperrone/status/1471941004001361920)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/268119626) ^rw268119626
