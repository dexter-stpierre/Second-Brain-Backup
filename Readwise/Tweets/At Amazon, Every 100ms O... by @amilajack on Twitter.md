## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- At amazon, every 100ms of latency costed us 1% in sales
  My team's goal was to cut https://t.co/GWQmrk4aI3's load time in half
  Here's what we did ðŸ§µ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/amilajack/status/1484970823005868033)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/275870523) ^rw275870523

- Load all content above the fold first
  We saw a 500ms win when migrating features and content to load ATF, increasing sales by 5%. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/amilajack/status/1484970824436117505)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/275870524) ^rw275870524
    - Date:: [[January 24th, 2022, Monday]]
- Server side render everything
  https://t.co/GWQmrk4aI3 is server side rendered and has no client side rendering framework. The potential latency hit didn't justify it.
  We were stuck with jQuery 1.6.4 ðŸ˜¬
  SSR React wasn't fast enough for us. This blew my mind. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/amilajack/status/1484970825568505856)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/275870525) ^rw275870525

- Track critical performance metrics
  We tracked:
  â€¢ time to load content above the fold
  â€¢ time to first suggestion
  â€¢ time to visual completeness
  â€¢ time to load ads
  â€¢ time to page layout ready
  â€¢ and many more... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/amilajack/status/1484970826818490373)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/275870526) ^rw275870526

- A/B test all critical changes
  If any release regressed our sales metrics, we'd revert. Simple as that. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/amilajack/status/1484970828122836993)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/275870527) ^rw275870527

- Drop unused polyfills
  Amazon still supports IE 10, which doesn't support Promises. We polyfilled it on IE but dropped it for modern browsers.
  I led the work for this! We dropped critical JS bundles by 10kb. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/amilajack/status/1484970829213433856)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/275870528) ^rw275870528

- Serve browser-specific bundles
  We detected browsers server side (via UA sniffing) and served bundles optimized for that browser.
  Teams could optionally define browser-specific features via a module's filename (ex. ./my-feature.ie.js) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/amilajack/status/1484970830362603520)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/275870529) ^rw275870529
