- What is difficult is not transferring content from place to place, but transferring it through time. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/58678838) ^rw58678838

- The challenge of knowledge is not acquiring it. In our digital world, you can acquire almost any knowledge at almost any time.
  The challenge is knowing which knowledge is worth acquiring. And then building a system to forward bits of it through time, to the future situation or problem or challenge where it is most applicable, and most needed. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/58678840) ^rw58678840

- The four top-level categories of P.A.R.A. — Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives — are designed to facilitate this process of forwarding knowledge through time. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/58678842) ^rw58678842

- Once we capture something, how do we structure the note so that it’s easily discoverable and usable in the future? [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/58678847) ^rw58678847

- I propose we make the design of individual notes the primary factor, instead of tags or notebooks. This has many advantages: [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/58678848) ^rw58678848

- It makes all work you do on your notes value-added, because you’re spending close to 100% of the time engaging directly with the content itself [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/58678849) ^rw58678849
    - Date:: [[May 8th, 2020, Friday]]
- It makes your notes more legible and useful to others (unlike your internal notebook structure, which is only for your use), promoting collaboration and sharing [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/58678850) ^rw58678850

- With a note-first approach, your notes become like individual atoms — each with its own unique properties, but ready to be assembled into elements, molecules, and compounds that are far more powerful. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/58678851) ^rw58678851

- Let’s start at the beginning: at the heart of every design, we are trying to balance priorities. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/58678852) ^rw58678852
    - Date:: [[May 8th, 2020, Friday]]
- In the case of notes, I believe the two priorities we are trying to balance are discoverability and understanding. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/58678853) ^rw58678853

- Making a note discoverable involves making it small, simple, and easy to digest. We accomplish this using compression: creating highly condensed summaries, without all the fluff. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/58678854) ^rw58678854
    - Date:: [[May 8th, 2020, Friday]]
- But we also want to make our notes understandable. This involves including all the context: the details, the examples, and cited sources to be sure nothing falls through the cracks. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/58678855) ^rw58678855
    - Date:: [[May 8th, 2020, Friday]]
- In making decisions about what to keep, you are inevitably making decisions about what to throw away. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/58678856) ^rw58678856
    - Date:: [[May 8th, 2020, Friday]]
- you cannot compress something without losing some of its context. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/58678857) ^rw58678857

- To communicate anything, you have to compress it, like communicating a huge amount of life experience in a wise saying. But in doing so, you lose a lot of the context that made that wisdom valuable in the first place. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/58678858) ^rw58678858

- If we compress a note too much, in other words, we make a summary that is too brief, we lose the context and it loses all meaning. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/58678859) ^rw58678859

- Getting the balance between compression and context right is not a trivial matter. When the time comes for Future You to decide whether or not to review this note, seconds count. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/58678860) ^rw58678860

- Progressive Summarization focuses therefore on rebalancing the equation. It is a method for opportunistic compression — summarizing and condensing a piece of information in small spurts, spread across time, in the course of other work, and only doing as much or as little as the information deserves.

- Progressive Summarization works in “layers” of summarization. Layer 0 is the original, full-length source text. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/58678862) ^rw58678862
    - Date:: [[May 8th, 2020, Friday]]
- Layer 1 is the content that I initially bring into my note-taking program. I don’t have an explicit set of criteria on what to keep. I just capture anything that feels insightful, interesting, or useful. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/58678863) ^rw58678863
    - Date:: [[May 8th, 2020, Friday]]
- Layer 1 is the starting point of Progressive Summarization, like the bedrock on which everything else is built: [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/58678864) ^rw58678864
    - Date:: [[May 8th, 2020, Friday]]
- Layer 2 is the first round of true summarization, in which I bold only the best parts of the passages I’ve imported. Again, I have no explicit criteria. I look for keywords, key phrases, and key sentences that I feel represent the core or essence of the idea being discussed. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/58678865) ^rw58678865
    - Date:: [[May 8th, 2020, Friday]]
- For Layer 3, I switch to highlighting, so I can make out the smaller number of highlighted passages among all the bolded ones. This time, I’m looking for the “best of the best,” only highlighting something if it is truly unique or valuable. And again, I’m only adding this third layer when I’m already reviewing the note anyway. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/58678866) ^rw58678866
    - Date:: [[May 8th, 2020, Friday]]
- For Layer 4, I’m still summarizing, but going beyond highlighting the words of others, to recording my own. For a small number of notes that are the most insightful, I summarize layers 2 and 3 in an informal executive summary at the top of the note, restating the key points in my own words. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/58678867) ^rw58678867
    - Date:: [[May 8th, 2020, Friday]]
- And finally, for a tiny minority of sources, the ones that are so powerful and exciting I want them to become part of how I think and work immediately, I remix them. After pulling them apart and dissecting them from every angle in layers 1–4, I add my own personality and creativity and turn them into something else.

    - Date:: [[May 8th, 2020, Friday]]
- all the previous layers are preserved in context, giving you the freedom to leave things out without worrying that you’ll lose them. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/58678869) ^rw58678869
