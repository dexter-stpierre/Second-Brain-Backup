- Federal housing maps created between 1935 and 1940, ostensibly to help mortgage lenders avoid risky loans, served to deepen the segregation process that housing covenants began. They relied on local developers and realtors to identify “hazardous” neighborhoods—a determination frequently based on race. As a result, people in minority neighborhoods found it difficult, if not impossible, to get a mortgage. The federal programs codified and standardized local knowledge, Connolly said: “Covenants were the critical foundation.” [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/98773723) ^rw98773723
    - Note: I feel that people today continue to determine if a neighborhood is dangerous based mostly on the people walking around, and ultimately by race, even if unintentionally ^rw98773723-note

- As the project demonstrates, digging up the racially restrictive past of property deeds take a lot of sweat and tears. But the zoning changes in Minneapolis and other legislative reforms indicate that they can have an impact: Minnesota and Washington enacted laws earlier this year that allow homeowners to renounce restrictive covenants in their deeds. “It’s only symbolic,” said Gregory—the covenants have been unenforceable for decades. “But it’s part of a necessary recognition that the past is still with us.” [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/98773724) ^rw98773724
    - Note: When we buy a house I want to find out if it has one of the covenants, and revoke it if it does ^rw98773724-note
