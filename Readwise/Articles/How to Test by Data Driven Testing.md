### New highlights synced
- work hard on making adding new tests trivial.

    - Note: I think this is super key. Build up data structures that can be reused ^rw283437061-note

- **Key point:** duh, test features, not code! [Test at the boundaries](https://www.tedinski.com/2019/03/19/testing-at-the-boundaries.html).
  If you build a library, the boundary is the public API. If you are building an application, you are not building the library. The boundary is what a human in front of a display sees.

- The core characteristic of the test suite is how easy it makes changing the software under test.

- Testing time is something worth optimizing for. Tests are sensitive to IO and IPC. Tests are relatively insensitive to the amount of code under tests.
