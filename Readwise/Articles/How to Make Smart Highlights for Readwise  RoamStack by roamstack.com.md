## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- Why do you highlight? What is it that sparked your attention that makes this snippet of text—someone else’s words—worth saving? ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1410516321/16321776)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/176901665) ^rw176901665
    - Note: An important question to ask when highlighting ^rw176901665-note

- Only save the part that gives enough context. Even better, write a note that explains why this resonates with you; take care of your future self by making the insight understandable in the future.

    - Note: It's hard to remember why something stuck out to you days, weeks, or years later. Writing out a little context helps preserve the value gained. ^rw176901666-note

- Most highlights in apps are extracted and saved in other apps. That’s often the reason to highlight digitally in the first place; to have easy access to your highlights and work with them. Unfortunately, the different reading apps and services don’t offer great integrations, making it difficult to extract highlights while having easy access to their original context.

    - Note: This is why I like Instapaper. I get to keep a copy of the information even if removed from the web. So I can never lose the context, and it is easy to click the link in Roam if I want to return to the source. I don't have the ease of accessing the source in paper books, but it is worth it to be able to use that medium ^rw176901667-note

- However, Readwise also has a tagging system. Any time it finds a note with a word that starts with a dot (.), it recognizes that word as a tag. So whereas in Roam you’d use a hashtag (#) like in #question or #idea, for Readwise you use .question or .idea (or .q and .i, and have Readwise turn them into full-length tags). When you export your highlights and notes to Roam, Readwise automatically turns the tags into Roam-compatible hashtags.

    - Note: This could be helpful if there is really specific context like that I want to keep in Roam. A question tag could be particularly useful. Just being in the habit of reviewing highlights would help too. ^rw176901668-note

- To string together highlights, you add the .c tag to a highlight as a note, followed by an increasing number. So, you start out by highlighting and add .c1 as a note to that highlight. What tag do you use for the next highlight you want to glue to .c1? I hope you guessed .c2! Want to add another snippet to the highlight? No problem, highlight something else and add a note with the .c3 tag.

- To create a new concatenated highlight, tag a highlight with .c1 to start a new snippet, adding subsequent highlights to it by using .c2, .c3, .c4, etc. Just make sure you don’t skip numbers or use two of the same number in a row; you might end up with a broken-up snippet after all.
