- BUT here is the thing: When these truths are pointed out by black people or actual historians, it doesn't mean we want to erase everything they did. It doesn't mean we don't think the founding fathers' legacy should be deleted. We just want y'all to tell the truth. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/87368854) ^rw87368854
    - Note: We need to shed light on the shortcomings of our national heroes. That isn’t to say that everything that they did is inheriently evil, we just need to remember that evil people can still do good things and good people can still do evil things. People, situations, and actions are a lot more complicated than we like to admit ^rw87368854-note

- The problem is that many white people believe that being a racist is an all-encompassing trait that stains everything else a person does. They believe it is an evil feeling that lives inside the heart. I do not. I think racism is a noun. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/87368855) ^rw87368855
    - Note: Racism is less about who we are as a person and more about how we act. We can act in antiracist ways one minute and in racist ways the next ^rw87368855-note

- For instance: The fact that police disproportionately shoot black people is racist. It does not mean that individual officers go to work hoping to kill black people. It means they work for a system that disproportionately target black Americans. That is racism. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/87368856) ^rw87368856

- He was able to view the WHOLE TRUTH of history and reconcile it with Gandhi's philosophy just like he understood that white people were racist and STILL believed he could change them. Wait... What? King would never say that. Not that whitewashed MLK you read about pic.twitter.com/2icoTSDNHb [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/87368857) ^rw87368857
    - Note: MLK Jr supported the idea that most white people are racist ^rw87368857-note

- Now "Racist" is a thing that people are — like a farmer or a cowboy or a Messiah or a human being or a serial rapist. It is up to the individual to determine whether or not someone who is that particular kind of noun deserves contempt, shame or forgiveness.

    - Note: We have to determine for ourselves if the evil that people have commited overweighs the good that they have put into the world ^rw87368858-note
