## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- Inversion: Avoiding stupidity is easier than trying to be brilliant. Instead of asking, “How can I help my company?” you should ask, “What’s hurting my company the most and how can I avoid it?” Identify obvious failure points, and steer clear of them. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/97300038) ^rw97300038
    - Note: Instead of trying to identify the best thing you should do identify the worst thing that you should stop doing. It will open more time and energy to do the good things ^rw97300038-note

- Theory of Constraints: A system is only as strong as its weakest point. Focus on the bottleneck. Counterintuitively, if you break down the entire system and optimize each component individually, you’ll lower the effectiveness of the system. Optimize the entire system instead. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/97300039) ^rw97300039
    - Note: Instead of trying to fix everything focus on the thing that is the most broken and fix that. The entire system will improve as a result ^rw97300039-note

- Secrets are Hidden in Plain Sight: Most people think of secrets as Easter eggs. They assume that if a secret is important, it’s necessarily going to be hard to find. The best ideas can come from things that are so well-known that they aren’t well-seen. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/97300040) ^rw97300040
    - Note: This makes me think of DoorDash. Everyone saw the opportunity that became a billion dollar business, only a few people moved on it ^rw97300040-note

- Look for Things That Don’t Make Sense: The world always makes sense. But it can be confusing. When it is, your model of the world is wrong. So, things that don’t make sense are a learning opportunity. Big opportunities won’t make sense until it’s too late to profit from them.

- The Wisdom of Paradox: Logic is the key to scientific truths, but paradoxes are the key to psychological ones. When it comes to the human condition, the deepest truths are often counter-intuitive. When you find two opposites that are both true, start exploring. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/97300042) ^rw97300042

- Opportunity Cost: By reading this tweet, you are choosing not to read something else. Everything we do is like this. Doing one thing requires giving up another. Whenever you explicitly choose to do one thing, you implicitly choose not to do another thing. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/97300043) ^rw97300043

- Goodhart’s Law: When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. One hospital took too long to admit patients so a penalty was given for 4+ hour wait times. In response, ambulance drivers were asked to slow down so they could shorten wait times. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/97300045) ^rw97300045

- Gall’s Law: A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.

- Hock Principle: Simple, clear purpose and principles give rise to complex and intelligent behavior. Complex rules and regulations give rise to simple and stupid behavior. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/97300047) ^rw97300047

- Parkinson’s Law: Work expands to fill the time available. People don’t want to look like they’re lazy, so they find extra tasks to tackle, even if they’re trivial. If you have six months to complete a project, it will take six months to complete. Set deadlines accordingly. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/97300048) ^rw97300048

- The Second Law of Thermodynamics: The world tends towards disorder. That’s why your room becomes messier and messier over time. It’s also why an engine converts only ~35% of its energy into useful work. Time moves towards increasing one direction: increasing entropy.

- Emergence: When things interact, they often birth new, unpredictable forms. Therefore, the sum total of a system is more than its competent parts. As a system evolves, its structure can transform — just like how water becomes cold water until it turns into ice. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/97300050) ^rw97300050

- Occam's Razor: If there are multiple explanations for why something happened and they are equally persuasive, assume the simplest one is true. In the search for truth, remove unnecessary assumptions. Trust the lowest-complexity answer. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/97300051) ^rw97300051

- Hickam’s Dictum: The opposite of Occam’s Razor. In a complex system, problems usually have more than one cause. For example, in medicine, people can have many diseases at the same time. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/97300052) ^rw97300052

- Circle of Competence: Define the limits of your knowledge. Hint: the limits are smaller than you think. That’s because being an expert in one area doesn’t make you an expert in anything else. Be clear about what you know and don’t know. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/97300053) ^rw97300053

- Via Negativa: When we have a problem, our natural instinct is to add a new habit or purchase a fix. But sometimes, you can improve your life by taking things away. For example, the foods you avoid are more important than the foods you eat. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/97300054) ^rw97300054

- Baker’s Dozen: The key to good hospitality is to delight your guests with an unexpected gift. If you run a hotel, leave a chocolate on the bed. If you run a bakery, give your customers one extra bagel. If you write a tweetstorm, share an extra idea. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/97300055) ^rw97300055

- The Paradox of Abundance: The average quality of information is getting worse and worse. But the best stuff is getting better and better. Markets of abundance are simultaneously bad for the median consumer but good for conscious consumers. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/97300056) ^rw97300056
