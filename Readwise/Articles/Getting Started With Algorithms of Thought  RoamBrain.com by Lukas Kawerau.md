## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- Broadly, algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving problems or achieving an end [Merriam Webster]. Algorithms of Thought then are procedures for thinking through a problem or situation to solve it. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/76506771) ^rw76506771

- That’s also what distinguishes Mental Algorithms from Mental Models: Mental Models are descriptive, they help to describe the world and reduce complexity through abstracting from reality. Mental Algorithms on the other hand are procedural – they guide you through a series of steps instead. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/76506772) ^rw76506772

- A very general algorithm of thought is the “Difference Engine”. Marvin Minsky describes a difference engine in his book The Emotion Machine like this:
  “At every step, this program compares its descriptions of the present and that future situation, and this produces a list of differences between them. Then it focuses on the most serious difference and applies some technique that has been designed to reduce this particular type of difference. If this succeeds, the program then tries to reduce what now seems to be the most serious difference. However, whenever such a step makes things worse, the system goes back and tries a different technique.” (Minsky 2006, 188) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/76708697) ^rw76708697

- The strength of the Difference Engine algorithm is also its weakness – it’s abstract enough to cover basically everything in some form. To prompt for better guidance and results, it’s useful to experiment with different implementations of this general concept. I’ll show you in the next section.

- That points to an important feature of algorithms of thought – you can combine them in infinite ways. The algorithms have brought you to a situation where now you can now employ a different algorithm – one for choosing between alternatives.

- If you’re thinking through tough choices, what also helps tremendously is finding the underlying assumptions. From this fantastic resource on Problem Solving Techniques by Robert Harris we can build an algorithm of thought that we can plug into the choice algorithm [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/76708706) ^rw76708706

- What’s particularly great about using these algorithms in Roam is that you can observe your problem solving and the performance of different algorithms over time. All you have to do is click the links in any algorithm and you can step through time using the Linked References section [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/76708707) ^rw76708707
