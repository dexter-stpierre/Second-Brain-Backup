## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- Live rounds are not allowed during filming, but productions sometimes opt for blanks over empty barrels because they create a realistic “bang!” sound. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1454688277/17800721)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/241339956) ^rw241339956
    - Note: Half the sounds in movies are recorded after filming, literally just record a gunshot outside of filming and edit it in ^rw241339956-note
