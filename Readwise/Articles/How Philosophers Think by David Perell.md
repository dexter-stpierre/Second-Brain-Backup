- Charlie Munger calls this the difference between “real knowledge” and “chauffeur knowledge.” He tells an apocryphal story about Max Planck, who went around the world giving the same knowledge about quantum mechanics after he won the Nobel Prize. After hearing the speech multiple times, the chauffeur asked Planck if he could give the next lecture. Planck said, “Sure.” At first, the lecture went well. But afterwards, a physics professor in the audience asked a follow-up question that stumped the chauffeur. Only Max Planck, who had the background knowledge to support the ideas in the talk, could answer it.

- you understand an idea not when you’ve memorized it, but when you know why its specific form was chosen over all the alternatives. Only once you’ve traveled the roads that were earnestly explored but ultimately rejected can you grasp an idea firmly and see it clearly, with all the context that supports it.

- The more pressure people feel to have an opinion on every subject, the more chauffeur knowledge there will be. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01frr520x2vcp0j81n82g1q9wg)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/267460198) ^rw267460198

- People who don’t have the tools to reason independently make up their minds by adopting the opinions of prestigious people. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01frr54jekycrtz2m79jgq9hyz)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/267460400) ^rw267460400
    - Note: I think talking about tools rather than the desire to reason independently is interesting here. Everyone WANTS to reason independently but not everyone know how to do it, how to gather the sources to do it, or how to find the flaws in their reasoning ^rw267460400-note

- Humanity has succeeded not because of the intelligence of atomic individuals, but because we’ve learned to outsource knowledge to the tribe. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01frr58nk7408gbkb6c5f11pbp)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/267460766) ^rw267460766

- if there’s anything I’ve learned about marketing, it’s that repetition is indistinguishable from truth. The more people are exposed to an idea, the more likely they are to believe it. ... But the popularity of an idea doesn’t make it correct. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/267461334) ^rw267461334

- Knowing that axioms will mold the ultimate shape of an idea, good philosophers tend to critique the premise of an idea—the frame—instead of the conclusion.

- when you restrict yourself to one side of the intellectual spectrum, you limit your capacity to find truth. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01frr5jf989749pq6tjw821n9m)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/267461996) ^rw267461996

- F. Scott Fitzgerald, who wrote *[The Great Gatsby](https://amzn.to/3idJs7t)* once said*:* “The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposing ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.” That’s what philosophers do so well. By oscillating between radical extremes, you put ideas at war with each other in the name of truth. By doing so, you stretch each idea to its logical conclusion.

- Only when others are charitable and give you the benefit of the doubt can you wholly reason towards truth and explore interesting ideas that may be flawed.

    - Note: This goes along with the point earlier that most that practice their faith in secret end up losing it. The same goes for ideas too ^rw267790672-note
