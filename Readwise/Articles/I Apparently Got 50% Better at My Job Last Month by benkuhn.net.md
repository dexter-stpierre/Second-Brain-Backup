- The decrease in communication time partly explains why I didn’t notice; the bulk of my communication happens in small chunks with frequent context switches to other things, so it’s hard for me to notice when it takes a lot of time. On the other hand, when I’m doing programming work I frequently get so absorbed that I lose track of time, so I don’t realize when I spend more time on that either. I suppose the point is that my impression of how I spend my time is incredibly unreliable! [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85302941) ^rw85302941

- BS timeboxes. I realized that I was spending a long time on things that needed to get done but didn’t feel important (a random recent selection: buying a mouse on Amazon, doing accounting, planning a trip, applying for Global Entry). My default pattern was basically doing things whenever I remembered about them and felt like I had time, or like they were sufficiently urgent. Instead of that, I added three weekly one-hour “BS timebox” events to my calendar and committed to working on urgent-but-unimportant tasks only during those windows. This both forced me to do them efficiently, and meant that I didn’t have to think about them for the other 163 hours in the week. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85302942) ^rw85302942
