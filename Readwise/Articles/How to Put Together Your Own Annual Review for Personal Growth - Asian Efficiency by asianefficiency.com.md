## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- The power of having a Failure list, that you keep updated once a month, is that you have a written record of all the little and big failures. We oftentimes learn more from our failures than our wins. I know for some people it might feel painful to write down a list of failures but that imaginary pain is worthwhile to go through to learn from your failures and to prevent them from happening in the future.

- I’ve learned that when you update your list only once a year or twice a year, you forget a lot of the little failures and wins you had. There’s a lot of insight and value you can have from seeing them on paper.
