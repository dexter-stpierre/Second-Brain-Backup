## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- the goal of writing a program is to turn inputs into outputs, while making good use of limited human and machine resources. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fy03kzpt272fhwc30tqa9mnv)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/297883692) ^rw297883692

- when I'm reading code it's because I want to learn what the code actually does, rather than what it says it does. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fy03mfj1714esx0r0n0qqwzm)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/297883705) ^rw297883705

- The foundational design question is always "what do I want the machine to do". Everything else is just a tool for concisely expressing that behavior. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fy4cx7rae5ety65kcmjkbqtj)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/298615018) ^rw298615018
    - Note: The only design decisions that matter are the ones that help you solve the problem in the easiest way. Nothing besides that matters ^rw298615018-note

- There is no point trying to get the code to correctly mirror the structure of reality because that structure doesn't exist. The categories [are in our heads](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yA4gF5KrboK2m2Xu7/how-an-algorithm-feels-from-inside), not out in the world, and they're only ever 'correct' to the extent that they are useful.

    - Note: Donâ€™t get hung up on matching some implicit structure that is strict. Allow yourself to implement a simple structure and adapt as needed in the future. Sometimes if structures are very similar you can use some kind of enumerator to determine which is which (ex: a type indicator to determine if an employee is permanent or a contractor ^rw298615081-note

- If there is a lot of repeated structure in the code try to move it into a function. If trying to reduce some particular repeated structure ends up making things more complicated, just live with the repetition instead.
