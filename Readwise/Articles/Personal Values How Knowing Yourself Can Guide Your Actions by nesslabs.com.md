- While people tend to appeal to logic to justify their stance, many of these positions are actually guided by their personal values. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365211784/15122345)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/130347393) ^rw130347393
    - Note: Personal values guide our opinions at least as much as logic. That is okay but you have to acknowledge it. And know when it makes a difference ^rw130347393-note

- They strongly influence our decisions, and yet, very few take the time to wonder: what are my personal values? ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365211784/15122368)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/130347394) ^rw130347394

- Despite the weight of culture on the way we form our personal values, individuals within each society vary in terms of values and importance they place on specific values. How much their values can deviate from the norm depends on the “cultural tightness or looseness” of the society, explains Pertii Pelto, an associate professor of anthropology at the University of Minnesota.

- Terminal values are our goals in life—our desirable states of existence. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365211784/15388145)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/140602167) ^rw140602167

- Instrumental values are the means by which we achieve the end goals. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365211784/15388149)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/140602168) ^rw140602168

- Researchers have identified four different personal value orientations based on our “terminal values” and “instrumental values”. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365211784/15388155)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/140602169) ^rw140602169

- how should we go about assessing our personal values? In The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, Mark Manson shares a practical framework. According to him, good values are evidence-based, constructive, and controllable, while bad values are emotion-based, destructive, and uncontrollable. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365211784/15388173)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/140602170) ^rw140602170
    - Note: Not sure I agree with this assessment. I believe that many good values can be based primarily in emotion, and that is okay. At times they might be backed by evidence, but their basis is still in emotion. But I think it is important to recognize whether a value is based in emotion or evidence ^rw140602170-note

- According to Mark Manson, good, healthy values that are evidence-based, constructive, and controllable include intellectual curiosity, creativity, humility, honesty, vulnerability, standing up for others, standing up for oneself. Bad, unhealthy values that are emotion-based, destructive, and uncontrollable include feeling good all the time, being the center of attention, being liked by everybody, and being wealthy for the sake of being wealthy.

    - Note: These all boil down to selfishness vs. unselfishness, which itself is either a good or bad value. This doesn’t feel like a thorough definition. ^rw140602171-note

- There are several ways you can go about discovering your personal values. The first one is to identify people you admire, and to think about why you admire them. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365211784/15388236)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/140602172) ^rw140602172
    - Note: Interesting idea here. We admire people for a reason and the reason might end up revealing hidden values that we didn’t even know we held. However I believe that this exercise only works if you only work off of the knowledge that you have. You can’t admire someone right now for a reason you do not know yet. There is likely something admirable about most people, but you have to know what they are to admire them. ^rw140602172-note
    - Date:: [[February 2nd, 2021, Tuesday]]
- The second strategy is simply to use a list of values ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365211784/15388246)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/140602173) ^rw140602173
    - Note: This seems super susceptible to bias, as most people would probably pick the values that make them feel the best. This can be helpful if trying to realign your values, but not for discovering what your existing ones are. ^rw140602173-note
    - Date:: [[February 2nd, 2021, Tuesday]]
- In order to dig deeper and further refine your values, journaling can be a useful reflection method. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365211784/15388258)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/140602174) ^rw140602174
    - Note: The things that you are constantly journaling about and participating in is a great way to reveal your values. Your values should be reflected in your calendar and bank statement ^rw140602174-note
    - Date:: [[February 2nd, 2021, Tuesday]]
- Beyond a list of values, ask yourself: where did these values come from? Are there any alternative values that would better capture my internal beliefs? How can I better align my actions with my values? ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365211784/15388263)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/140602175) ^rw140602175
    - Note: These are always in flux and you can choose to work on them. But it should be intentional or else unintentional things will hijack your values ^rw140602175-note
    - Date:: [[February 2nd, 2021, Tuesday]]
- In order to be useful, values must be lived. Holding personal values but failing to use them to guide our actions amounts to the same as not holding these values at all. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365211784/15388266)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/140602176) ^rw140602176
    - Date:: [[February 2nd, 2021, Tuesday]]
- As Mark Manson puts it: “Our values are constantly reflected in the way we choose to behave. This is critically important—because we all have a few things that we think and say we value, but we never back them up with our actions. (…) Many of us state values we wish we had as a way to cover up the values we actually have. In this way, aspiration can often become another form of avoidance. Instead of facing who we really are, we lose ourselves in who we wish to become.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365211784/15388273)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/140602177) ^rw140602177

- In fact, it is probably healthier for your values to change over the course of your life based on what you learn from your experiences and relationships with others. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365211784/15388292)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/140602178) ^rw140602178
    - Note: Values don’t only change because you discover “better” ones, but also because your focus is different in different parts of your lives. They naturally evolve as you go through life ^rw140602178-note
    - Date:: [[February 2nd, 2021, Tuesday]]
- Confront your values to actual experiences. Again, values do not exist in vacuum. Whenever you notice a contradiction between one of your values and your lived experience, take the time to reflect and consider whether your value actually reflects the way you want to behave in the world. If that’s not the case, it may be time to let go of that particular value, or to replace it with a new, better suited value. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365211784/15388300)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/140602179) ^rw140602179
    - Date:: [[February 2nd, 2021, Tuesday]]
- Finally, you don’t need to wait until experience contradicts your values, or until you feel disappointed in a value-led outcome in your life. You can actively question your values at a more abstract level. Especially in the case of values that were transmitted to you through your upbringing, education, or culture, it may be helpful to wonder: do I really want to live my life according to these values? Are there better values I should consider instead? ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365211784/15388315)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/140602180) ^rw140602180
    - Note: Questioning values is both acceptable and important. It should be done regularly. Ask yourself if it is still something you value ^rw140602180-note
    - Date:: [[February 2nd, 2021, Tuesday]]
- The goal is not to collect values to cling onto for the rest of your life. Instead, it is to live a life of self-discovery. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365211784/15388316)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/140602181) ^rw140602181
