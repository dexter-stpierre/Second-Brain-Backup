- I think happiness is a by-product, it’s something that’s realized rather than pursued. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411772614/16573125)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/186846936) ^rw186846936

- I think wanting to be happy all the time, trying to be happy all the time– I think that’s a sort of madness. It’s a very unfair, unrealistic expectation to have, and it guarantees dissatisfaction.
