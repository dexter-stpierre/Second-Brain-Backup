- It's ok to think that things have flaws or could be improved. But it's a trap to believe that it's ever the case that a simple solution exists and everyone else is just too enfeebled of character to push the miracle button.

- If you're really attracted to novelty you can spend all your time jumping between new things and never actually engage with the mainstream. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fsfw2bp80ge3n72ppb7174f3)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/271500593) ^rw271500593

- there is value in exploring new ideas, but to be able to sift through the bad ideas and nurture the good ones you have to already thoroughly understand the existing solutions.

    - Note: Understanding the current working solutions is a key step to understanding how new approaches differ and if they are missing important aspects of the current successful solutions ^rw271502055-note

- after implementing some hot new idea I couldn't tell if it was good or bad because I had no baseline to compare it to. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fsfwmwvsynb5g4mxw5ke3jpy)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/271502344) ^rw271502344

- The frontier is the place to go mining for new ideas, but it's 1% gold and 99% mud. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fsfwq8p88zrthzz59bc7bqj7)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/271502490) ^rw271502490

- Learning X will make you a better programmer
  For the most popular values of X, I haven't found this to be true.
  I think these claims are a lot like how people used to say that [learning latin makes you smarter](https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/why-we-should-all-learn-to-speak-latin.html). Sure, learning things is fun. And various bits of knowledge are often useful within their own domain. But overwhelmingly, the thing that made me better at programming was doing lots of programming, and especially working on problems that pushed the limits of my abilities.

- Life is short and you don't get to learn more than a tiny fraction of the knowledge and skills available, so if you want to make really cool stuff then you need to spend most of your time on the highest-leverage options and spend only a little time on the lottery tickets.
