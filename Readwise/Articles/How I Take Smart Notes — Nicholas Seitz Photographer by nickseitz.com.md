## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- I had always found resonance (and still do, to some extent) with the idea that individual readings are like meals. We don’t necessarily remember every meal we eat, yet the quantity and quality of the things we eat (or read) has a strong effect on what kind of lives we live.

    - Note: This is an interesting thought about the value of reading, even if we don’t interact with the text in a way that many would consider meaningful ^rw240895381-note

- by just taking notes on this page that were separate from the reading, I may have felt like I was generating insight, but that insight was orphaned in time. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1453193056/17788076)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/240895382) ^rw240895382
    - Note: I think this author is viewing their past self through their current lenses. Odds are that their past self didn’t believe they were generating insights at all. Their past self might not have cared about generating insights. And that’s perfectly okay. Having the goal of trying to draw insights doesn’t inherently make you a better person. It just makes you a person with a different goal. Much how a body builder might have no interesting in running a marathon but a marathon runner and a body builder are both accomplished athletes 
      * I don’t actually know what the authors goals were at the time that they made this note ^rw240895382-note
