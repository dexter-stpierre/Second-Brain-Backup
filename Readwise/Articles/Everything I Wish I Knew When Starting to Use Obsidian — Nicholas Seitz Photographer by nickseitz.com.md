## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- every functional complex system emerges out of a simpler system that worked first. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1452899465/17769945)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/240113223) ^rw240113223
    - Note: I need to be better at just following the simple systems first ^rw240113223-note

- you have to earn complexity. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1452899465/17769948)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/240113224) ^rw240113224

- By making an honest effort to try out a systemic approach to note-taking, you will most likely realize quickly what is busywork, what is over-complicated, and simply- what is friction.

    - Note: I think I experienced a lot of friction with Roam’s “frictionless” system and just denied it. I couldn’t do a simple organizational thing like throwing certain kinds of pages into a folder that clearly stated what they were, so instead I had to create a more complicated system for handling simple kinds of notes. This wasn’t optimal for me and required a lot of work ^rw240238668-note

- The irony of recognizing that something you were doing was unhelpful busywork is that, if you think the solution is to go back and correct all the errors, you have just created more busywork.

- Understand what fruitfulness looks like when using your vault, and continue working at it such that that fruit can actually grow. Over time, you will experience the friction of unproductive processes. Where there is the most friction, simply prune those processes out of your workflow and continue working.

- each note should contain roughly one idea, and it should be titled as a claim or a noun which will be defined. This allows you to think of ideas as discrete building-blocks to larger systems or theories. When the blocks bump into each other in interesting ways, or when you use one block in multiple structures of thoughts, that’s where ideas start to emerge in interesting ways.

- I think there’s value in writing down bare, interesting facts and mixing that in with your Obsidian vault. You may also write in that note or a note to go with it on why you found that interesting. If you write down why it’s interesting and link it to an existing concept, you’re starting to let interesting facts and ideas bump into each other.

    - Note: When you record why an idea is valuable you end up with links to other ideas and create a real web of knowledge. Sometimes a fact all by itself is interesting, but if you record why it was interesting and how it relates to your other interests you have something really useful ^rw240261074-note

- when a note is a single fact or statement, it becomes easier to find or integrate into other contexts. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1452899465/17774430)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/240337060) ^rw240337060
    - Note: Instead of trying to pull a piece of information out of a note and bring it into another context I can simply refer to this piece of atomic information ^rw240337060-note

- Doing good work slowly is better than doing shoddy work quickly. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1452899465/17774650)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/240347332) ^rw240347332

- you have a limited time to add things in to your vault, so choose well what to add. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1452899465/17774969)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/240347333) ^rw240347333
