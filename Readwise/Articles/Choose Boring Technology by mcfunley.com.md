## Highlights

- Let’s say every company gets about three innovation tokens. You can spend these however you want, but the supply is fixed for a long while. You might get a few more after you achieve a certain level of stability and maturity, but the general tendency is to overestimate the contents of your wallet. Clearly this model is approximate, but I think it helps. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1388522501/15600549)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/149064554) ^rw149064554
    - Note: The best way to ensure that your product remains maintainable is to limit the amount of complexity (innovation). The more difficult the pieces of your system are to maintain the more time you spend working on your system rather than building your product ^rw149064554-note

- In that context, devoting any of your limited attention to innovating ssh is an excellent way to fail. Or at best, delay success . ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1388522501/15600563)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/149064555) ^rw149064555
    - Note: Giving energy to unnecessary innovation takes focus away from building out your mission. More energy into innovation = less energy into accomplishing your goal. Writing our own analytics engine might allow us to have more customized analytics, but it doesn’t work towards our goal of creating the best tool for helping seperated parents ^rw149064555-note

- I unapologetically think a bias in favor of boring technology is a good thing, but it’s not the only factor that needs to be considered. Technology choices don’t happen in isolation. They have a scope that touches your entire team, organization, and the system that emerges from the sum total of your choices.

- Your function in a nutshell is to map business problems onto a solution space that involves choices of software. If the choices of software were truly without baggage, you could indeed pick a whole mess of locally-the-best tools for your assortment of problems.

- We call the baggage “operations” and to a lesser extent “cognitive overhead.” You have to monitor the thing. You have to figure out unit tests. You need to know the first thing about it to hack on it. You need an init script. I could go on for days here, and all of this adds up fast.

    - Note: The costs that come with a software choice is all of the things involved with maintaining it. If you use 4 different languages or frameworks when 1 or 2 would do then you will spend a lot of time just learning the first things about each rather than becoming deeply knowledgable in one or two ^rw149075069-note

- Your job is keeping the company in business, god damn it. And the “best” tool is the one that occupies the “least worst” position for as many of your problems as possible.

- An important first step is to acknowledge that this is a process, and a conversation. New tech eventually has company-wide effects, so adding tech is a decision that requires company-wide visibility.

    - Note: Technology is not a vacuum. The decisions made there impact the entire company and people in every area should have an ability to have their voices heard ^rw149075071-note

- One of the most worthwhile exercises I recommend here is to consider how you would solve your immediate problem without adding anything new. First, posing this question should detect the situation where the “problem” is that someone really wants to use the technology. If that is the case, you should immediately abort. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1388522501/15600675)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/149075072) ^rw149075072
    - Note: Wanting a new technology isn’t enough of a reason to add one. The new technology should solve the problem better than the available alternatives ^rw149075072-note
    - Date:: [[February 22nd, 2021, Monday]]
- It’s helpful to write down exactly what it is about the current stack that makes solving the problem prohibitively expensive and difficult. This is related to the previous exercise, but it’s subtly different.

- New technology choices might be purely additive (for example: “we don’t have caching yet, so let’s add memcached”). But they might also overlap or replace things you are already using. If that’s the case, you should set clear expectations about migrating old functionality to the new system. The policy should typically be “we’re committed to migrating,” with a proposed timeline. The intention of this step is to keep wreckage at manageable levels, and to avoid proliferating locally-optimal solutions. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1388522501/15600686)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/149075074) ^rw149075074
    - Note: Don’t just replace old technologies in one area. If a technology is worth moving to then come up with a timetable to be fully migrated. If you are changing technologies to only solve one specific problem then more creative time with your existing technologies is probably necessary ^rw149075074-note

- Mindful choice of technology gives engineering minds real freedom: the freedom to contemplate bigger questions. Technology for its own sake is snake oil. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1388522501/15600723)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/149080582) ^rw149080582
    - Note: The problem of deciding which tech to use can be a tough decision, but it isn’t a particularly interesting challenge. By simplifying technology choices you no longer have to ask “what is the best technology to solve this problem” you now get to ask “what is the best way to solve this problem”. And maybe, just maybe, a certain piece of tech is part of that answer ^rw149080582-note
