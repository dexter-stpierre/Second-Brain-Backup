- The latest global data tells us that the huge majority – 85% of the world population – live on less than $30 per day. That means 6.5 billion people. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fqdbysehdsb081bp76c17a0q)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/260608298) ^rw260608298

- Extreme poverty is defined [by the UN](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/poverty/) as living on less than $1.90 a day. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fqdc04vf4eknzt7q44hrek30)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/260608346) ^rw260608346

- If we’d only rely on the poverty line from high-income countries we would hide the very stark differences between people with very different living standards. Whether someone was living on almost $30 a day or on 30-times less would not matter – they would all be considered ‘poor’.

- The $1.90 poverty line, set by the UN, shows that globally close to one in ten people live in extreme poverty. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fqdc28hkn1j9m5kfhxcqc4m4)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/260608384) ^rw260608384

- In all these statistics the researchers are not only taking people’s monetary income into account, but also their non-monetary income and home production. One reason why this is important is because many poor people are small scale farmers who produce their own food.

    - Note: If someone produces $5/day worth of food that is accounted for ^rw260608385-note

- Economic growth made it possible to leave the widespread extreme poverty of the past behind. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fqdcrdrzbepvrk9a4r764482)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/260609493) ^rw260609493

- Growth [means](https://ourworldindata.org/what-is-economic-growth) that a society produces an increasing quantity and quality of economic goods and services. The key to economic growth is the development of technology that makes it possible to increase productivity by which these goods and services are produced.
  Because the total production in an economy equals the total income in that country – as everyone’s spending is someone else’s income – incomes grow at the same rate as production increases.

    - Note: The key that the author identifies for economic growth is not any particular economic system but the key factor is technology that leads to an increase in productivity ^rw260609491-note

- The 9 charts show the data for different regions in the world. On the x-axis of each chart you find the average income (GDP per capita) and on the y-axis you see the share living in extreme poverty. The starting point of each trajectory shows the data for 1820 and it tells us that two centuries ago the majority of people lived in extreme poverty, no matter where in the world they were at home.[12](https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty-in-brief) Since then all world regions achieved growth – the production of goods and services increased – and the share living in poverty declined. ... ![](https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2021/11/Growth-and-poverty-since-1820-OECD-data-Revision.png) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/260609432) ^rw260609432

- Not all African countries are struggling, in fact most African countries have achieved good growth after the end of the oppressive colonial regimes [that hindered the growth](https://voxeu.org/article/colonialism-and-development-africa) of African economies.

    - Note: It's important to recognize the impact that colonialism had on many of these low income countries ^rw260609691-note

- For poor countries, the only way to end poverty is an increase of incomes – and that means economic growth. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fqddntr4v0gat2s6djz6y02t)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/260609994) ^rw260609994

- The worry with extreme poverty today is that some of the world’s poorest countries are not growing. Unless this changes hundreds of millions of people will continue to live in extreme poverty.

    - Note: I wonder if this person believes that capitalism is the answer to poverty. I think so much has changed in the world in the last 200 years so I think it would be a stretch to attribute it all to capitalism. I'd be interested to see more metrics and if economic modals made a difference, or only economic growth ^rw260613297-note

- When it comes to the consequences of climate change this is what I am most worried about. Richer people will be able to adapt in many ways. It is the extremely poor population that will be hardest hit.

    - Note: I think the author is naive to think that the rich will be able to avoid the consequences of climate change. Maybe they will for a small amount of time but as the tornadoes is Kentucky and the winter storm in Texas showed no one will be able to completely avoid the consequences ^rw260613782-note
