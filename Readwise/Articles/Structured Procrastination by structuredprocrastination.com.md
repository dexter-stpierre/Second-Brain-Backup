## Highlights

- Procrastinators seldom do absolutely nothing; they do marginally useful things, like gardening or sharpening pencils or making a diagram of how they will reorganize their files when they get around to it.

- If all the procrastinator had left to do was to sharpen some pencils, no force on earth could get him do it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fsw91q7nr7pgk5tybzs6z538)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/273810685) ^rw273810685

- the procrastinator can be motivated to do difficult, timely and important tasks, as long as these tasks are a way of not doing something more important. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fsw93wnzp40y82pngz4p2y3q)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/273810745) ^rw273810745

- Procrastinators often follow exactly the wrong tack. They try to minimize their commitments, assuming that if they have only a few things to do, they will quit procrastinating and get them done. But this goes contrary to the basic nature of the procrastinator and destroys his most important source of motivation. The few tasks on his list will be by definition the most important, and the only way to avoid doing them will be to do nothing. This is a way to become a couch potato, not an effective human being.
