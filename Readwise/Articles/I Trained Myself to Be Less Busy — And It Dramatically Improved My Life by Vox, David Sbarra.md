## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- The first change took root for me about 18 months ago when the graduate program that I direct started teaching Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (pronounced as the single word ACT) to our doctoral students, who are future clinical psychologists. ACT is a scientifically validated psychotherapy treatment for a range of mental health problems. Basically, it’s a form of talk therapy.

- A central tenet of ACT is that emotional pain is driven in large part by getting over-involved in difficult experiences and thoughts (that is, going over and over things in our mind, getting stuck in our experiences, and being unable to create any psychological distance between yourself and the terribleness of things).

- when we become stuck on or in our emotional pain, we go through each day in a way that is disconnected from our core values — the essential principles that, ideally, come to guide our lives. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/55153994) ^rw55153994

- As I learned more about ACT and started incorporating its methods into my psychotherapy practice with clients, something important dawned on me: Busyness devoured my values. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/55153995) ^rw55153995

- Busyness is not, nor was it ever, a guiding principle in my life. Yet, I had let the inertia of doing take deep root without realizing what was happening to me. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/55153996) ^rw55153996

- I started with a simple value: being outside. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/55153998) ^rw55153998

- Walking provides time to think, to be energized by nature, and to feel less frenzied. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/55153999) ^rw55153999

- Kreider writes, “This busyness serves as a kind of existential reassurance, a hedge against emptiness. Obviously your life cannot possibly be silly, or trivial, or meaningless if you are so busy, completely booked every hour of the day. All this noise, and rush, and stress seem contrived to cover up some fear at the center of our lives.” [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/55154001) ^rw55154001

- I’ve found that the less I work, the better my work actually is in the end, from the ability to attend to students and clients to the creative energies needed for doing science. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/55154002) ^rw55154002

- I’ve also tried to get serious about laughing more. For me, busyness’s neighbor is seriousness. Seriousness is overrated, and I feel much healthier and even childlike when I am not taking myself so seriously, and when I am trying to make other people laugh.

- Sometimes I look at my schedule shout to myself, “Too much, too much!” When this is the case, I just go for a walk. Or I just get on the floor and mess with my kids. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/55154004) ^rw55154004

- By and large, though, I am feeling better than I have in a long time — more deliberate in the choices I make, more connected to the people around me, and more energized for the demands of the day. The surprising irony here, for me at least, is that by doing less, I am getting way more out life. I have banished my inner robot. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/55154005) ^rw55154005
