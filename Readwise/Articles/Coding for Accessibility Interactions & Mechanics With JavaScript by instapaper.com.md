## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- A tabindex value of 0 will add an element to the page's tab order according to its place in the DOM, and a value of -1 will remove it from the manual tab order while still making it focusable by script. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1410660419/16371545)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178512397) ^rw178512397
    - Note: When creating custom elements you should only use a tabindex of 0 or -1. And positive number will cause the order to be all messed up ^rw178512397-note

- A common gotcha when learning about accessibility is that not every element needs to be keyboard-interactive. Screen readers have dedicated commands for headings and landmarks (among other things), so tabindex isn't necessary for those items.

    - Note: If you are using as many semantic elements as possible then you don’t need to make elements keyboard interactive if you won’t actually interact with them. Screen readers handle various elements well ^rw178512398-note

- take the No Mouse Challenge and work without a mouse or trackpad each week to ensure UIs are reachable and operable from the keyboard. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1410660419/16371609)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178572594) ^rw178572594
    - Note: Do regular no mouse days to ensure that you are building sites that are available to keyboard users. As a bonus you will also learn a bunch of keyboard shortcuts ^rw178572594-note

 There are some established conventions with keyboard access, such as binding the Escape key to close a dialog and return to a triggering button element. Before trying to invent patterns for keyboard access based on a new design that was passed to you, do some research on common conventions using the W3C's ARIA Authoring Practices Guide and/or Inclusive Components from Heydon Pickering.

    - Note: Don’t have unexpected responses to input and don’t miss out on expected responses to input ^rw178572595-note

- focusable components can also be reached with a screen reader running. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1410660419/16371635)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178572596) ^rw178572596
    - Note: Better keyboard support will lead to better, but not perfect, screen reader support ^rw178572596-note

- There's the possibility that if you tweak a design to look and function more like a standard component, you'll be able to leverage common navigation paradigms and make the interface more intuitive to users.
