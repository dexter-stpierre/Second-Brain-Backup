- The culture understands it needs to write tests, but is unwilling to accept that writing good tests (a secondary concern!) is actually much more difficult than writing good code.

- if you take the time to learn how to write great tests, writing great code is easy. It hones your ability to break down work, name & organize, design easy-to-use code with clear contracts.

    - Note: I think getting better at writing tests would be a huge step for coding better. I need to spend time learning more on this topic ^rw283451619-note
