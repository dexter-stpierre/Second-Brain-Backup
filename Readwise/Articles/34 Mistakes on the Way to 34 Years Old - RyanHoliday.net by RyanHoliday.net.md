## Highlights

- When I look back on my own writing, the stuff that makes me cringe isn’t necessarily even stuff I was wrong about. [What disturbs me is the certainty](https://humanparts.medium.com/why-are-we-so-certain-about-our-mistakes-e7f8ee6ab4c2). I thought I knew, *but I didn’t really know.* I wasn’t even close to knowing. [Ego](https://store.dailystoic.com/collections/all-books/products/copy-of-the-obstacle-is-the-way-signed-edition) never ages well, even if it was correct in a narrow instance. As I get older, I’d like to think I am more open to nuance, less prone to black and white statements, and humbler in how I come off.

- Needing things to be a certain way has continually prevented me from enjoying them as they are. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01frt8kxegygpfq0x0wcvfmc72)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/267799118) ^rw267799118

- Communication is not conflict. It *preempts* and *prevents* conflict. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01frt8nfrhgs8d1ytxsj27y5vp)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/267799721) ^rw267799721

- My anxiety has brought about exactly the kind of stress or frustration I was hoping to avoid infinitely more times than it has prevented it from happening.

- I grew up in a mostly conservative household, one that internalized a lot of that Reagan-esque suspicion of governing. But of course, this suspicion—especially when widely held—contributes to poor governance. Government is not a thing, at least in America. *We are the government,* just as much as we are traffic, we are culture, we are media*.* A line I heard that changed my worldview: “Government is simply the name we give to the things we choose to do together.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01frt8tqd8tavbqa9nkmhs9w48)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/267799956) ^rw267799956

- the key to progress, I have found, is relatively simple. It’s not to avoid error…but to avoid making the same error more than once. Or, more realistically, *fewer times than you might ordinarily be inclined to.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01frt8xddeg53f482wq3vv9trm)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/267800568) ^rw267800568
