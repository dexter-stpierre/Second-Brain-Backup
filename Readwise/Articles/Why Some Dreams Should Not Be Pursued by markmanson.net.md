    - Note: I think this is one of the flaws of the business. They encourage people to write out hundreds of dreams when in reality all those dreams are is a brainstorming list. They aren’t deep desires that people are truly motivated to work for ^rw190348663-note

- The truth is that pain, longing, and frustration are just a fact of life. We believe that our dreams will solve all of our current problems without recognizing that they will simply create new variants of the same problems we experience now.

    - Note: Idealized futures forget about a striking reality of life: life includes pain, sadness, and hard times. Many of the same problems we have now will still be present in our idealized future. Some of the problems will disappear and many new ones will appear.
