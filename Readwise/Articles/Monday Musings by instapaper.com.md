## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- Here’s how Nathan Weller expanded on the idea: “When you have a set of story beats (or an outline in other words) and you can put the words “and then” in-between each one–“you’re fucked” as Trey would say. That’s boring. However, if in-between each story beat you can put the words “but” or “therefore” then you have a story in which the events taking place are reacting to each other. The story/plot builds momentum and tension based on everything else that has happened previously, not because of the arbitrary whims of the writer.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1391720754/15685505)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/152751876) ^rw152751876
    - Note: A good story isn’t just a sequence of events, it is exploring the consequences of events that take place ^rw152751876-note

- Around the time of Facebook’s IPO, employees received a little red book. The last page is fascinating. It says: “If we don’t create the thing that kills Facebook, someone else will. ‘Embracing change’ isn’t enough. It has to be so hardwired into who we are that even talking about it seems redundant. The Internet is not a friendly place. Things that don’t stay relevant don’t even get the luxury of leaving ruins. They disappear.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1391720754/15685538)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/152751878) ^rw152751878
    - Note: This could explain Facebook’s purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp. If someone else creates the thing that will eliminate your business then buy them. This also explains things like Instagram Reels and Twitters for voice chat rooms ^rw152751878-note
