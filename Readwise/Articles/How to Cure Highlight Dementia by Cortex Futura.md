## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- Sure, not every sentence in a book is important, but unless your strategy in marking up texts is to close your eyes and move the highlighter randomly, a highlight is a signal that the sentence was important to you in that moment. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85534696) ^rw85534696

- Now, why can’t people reconstruct the meaning of a highlight? It happens because people don’t have a reading strategy beyond “I’m going to read this, now”. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85534697) ^rw85534697

- The most important thing to do to prevent Highlight Dementia is creating context around your highlights. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85534698) ^rw85534698

- For every highlight that you make, try to also note down a couple of words on why you are highlighting the sentence. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85534699) ^rw85534699

- Creating context around your highlights is also independent of the medium you’re reading the book in and take your notes. You can write in the margins of a paper book or put notes into your Kindle highlights, and so on. The important thing is that you do more than just “mark up” a text - you have to create context.

    - Note: The Kindle keyboard sucks.. Maybe I will find it more usable if I use it more. Maybe I can also consider making hand written notes in a notebook while reading in my kindle. I could number my notes and put that in the note on the kindle so they are easy to map to each other ^rw85534700-note
