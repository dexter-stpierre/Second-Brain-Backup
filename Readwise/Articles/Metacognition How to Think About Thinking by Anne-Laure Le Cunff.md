## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- Metacognitive knowledge. What you know about yourself and others in terms of thinking and learning processes. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/93678970) ^rw93678970
    - Note: Metacognitive Knowledge is the knowledge I have about how to learn and think. This grows as I read and watch material about thinking and learning processes and the lessons that I earn while going through the processes ^rw93678970-note

- Metacognitive regulation. The activities and strategies you use to control your learning. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/93678971) ^rw93678971
    - Note: Metacognitive Regulation is the system for how I go about learning and thinking. It is tools, strategies, and processes that have proven reliable in the past to assist in learning and thinking. It is important to adjust as I learn more about learning and as my experience shows certain strategies to be more or less valuable ^rw93678971-note

- Metacognitive experiences. The thoughts and feelings you have while studying and learning something. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/93678972) ^rw93678972
    - Note: Metacognitive Experience is the feeling and thoughts I have about and while learning and thinking. It is important to make changes to ensure that thinking and learning are pleasurable activities. Enjoyment is a great motivator ^rw93678972-note

- Planning. Before you start learning something new, think about the appropriate learning strategies you will use, as well as how you will allocate your time and energy. This phase is based on your metacognitive knowledge—of yourself, learning strategies, and when to use them to maximise your performance.

    - Note: It is important to go into a session of learning or thinking with a well formulated plan. This likely follows a template that I have set up that follows what has been successful for me in the past. This also includes deciding which material I will review and having them ready so I don’t need to search for them when I am in a flow of writing or thinking. Planning well will help the other two skills ^rw93678973-note

- Monitoring. While learning, stay aware of your progress. Are you struggling with certain aspects in particular? Are there other sections that seem to be a breeze to go through? Instead of passively experiencing your thoughts and feelings, always question everything. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/93678975) ^rw93678975
    - Note: It is important for me to be aware of progress and emotions as I do the work of thinking and learning. Are there certain sections that I need to spend more time solidifying? What questions are coming to mind? It is important to be aware of how I am progressing and how both the material I am working on as well as my strategies put in place are affecting my progress ^rw93678975-note

- Evaluating. When you’re done with a chunk, consider how well you performed and re-evaluate the strategies you used. Make any necessary changes before starting to work on the next part of your learning project. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/93678976) ^rw93678976
    - Note: At good stopping points it is important to evaluate my observations of how I am progressing and determine if there are certain parts of my plan that need adjusting ^rw93678976-note
