- What I explained then, and what I have said many times since, is that Trump is fundamentally unfit—intellectually, morally, temperamentally, and psychologically—for office. For me, that is the paramount consideration in electing a president, in part because at some point it’s reasonable to expect that a president will face an unexpected crisis—and at that point, the president’s judgment and discernment, his character and leadership ability, will really matter.

    - Note: One of the critical factors in voting for someone for president is how they would handle a crisis. I need to ensure that I trust their character, leadership, discernment, and decision making skills when that time comes ^rw93989106-note

- To be sure, the president isn’t responsible for either the coronavirus or the disease it causes, COVID-19, and he couldn’t have stopped it from hitting our shores even if he had done everything right. Nor is it the case that the president hasn’t done anything right; in fact, his decision to implement a travel ban on China was prudent. And any narrative that attempts to pin all of the blame on Trump for the coronavirus is simply unfair. The temptation among the president’s critics to use the pandemic to get back at Trump for every bad thing he’s done should be resisted, and schadenfreude is never a good look.

    - Note: When making criticism on Trump’s presidency we should resist the urge to get back at him by blaming him completely for the Coronavirus. A fair criticism acknowledges that the coronavirus would have come even if he did everything right, but he still played a role in it being as bad as it is. And he also had many other successes and failures in his time as president ^rw93989107-note
