- “New goals don’t deliver new results. New lifestyles do.
  And a lifestyle is a process, not an outcome.
  For this reason, your energy should go into building better habits, not chasing better results.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1396339313/15855120)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/158611948) ^rw158611948
    - Note: The best way to accomplish your next goal isn't to set a goal, it's to change your life in a way that naturally accomplishes the goal. Set yourself up in such a way that you don't have to work hard to accomplish your goals, your lifestyle will just naturally accomplish them. ^rw158611948-note

- “Some things are better off ignored than attacked.
  Attention is the oxygen of conflict. When you fight a problem, you breathe life into it. When you starve a problem of your attention, you suffocate it.
  In a surprising number of cases, the way to solve a problem is to ignore it.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1396339313/15855127)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/158611949) ^rw158611949
    - Note: This might be true in your own personal life, but as a society or in a relationship this is bad advice. In a relationship you must communicate that change is necessary and as a society we must bring national attention to things that need to change. This might give the appearance that it has caused there to be more instances of the problem but in all likelihood we will just be noticing it more when it does happen due to the attention put on it. ^rw158611949-note

- “The events of your past are fixed. The meaning of your past is not.
  The influence of every experience in your life is determined by the meaning you assign to it.
  Assign a more useful meaning to your past and it becomes easier to take a more useful action in the present.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1396339313/15855134)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/158611950) ^rw158611950

- Teacher and novelist Amelia Barr on the difference between mediocrity and genius:
  “Everything good needs time. Don’t do work in a hurry. Go into details; it pays in every way. Time means power for your work. Mediocrity is always in a rush; but whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing with consideration. For genius is nothing more nor less than doing well what anyone can do badly.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1396339313/15855161)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/158611951) ^rw158611951
    - Note: If you consider something worth giving some of your effort consider giving it a great deal of effort. If something is worth doing it is worth doing a good job. But also don't let the pressure of doing a good job prevent you from getting started. If something is worth doing it is worth doing badly, even if that means that you have to redo it later ^rw158611951-note
