## Highlights

- Create a Rhythm: Great writing has rhythm. It's like a dance, and words are the music that create the atmosphere. The easiest way to add rhythm to your writing is to vary sentence length. Short sentences speed things up, and long sentences slooooooowwwwww things down.

- Eliminate Anything That Adds Confusion: Read your writing out-loud, and mark the places where you stumble. It’ll usually happen because of an unnecessarily big word or a sentence with irregular syntax. Wait to make edits as you read. Read a few paragraphs at a time and bold the parts that cause you to stumble. That way, you can get into the same flow your reader will experience when they enjoy your work. Then, edit your writing in sections. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1355518805/14591326)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/110377413) ^rw110377413

- Add Colorful Details: Sol Stein once wrote: “Good writing is supposed to evoke sensation in the reader, not the fact that it’s raining, but the feeling of being rained upon.” That feeling is revealed through detail. Make your reader feel the puddle of water in your shoes, the frustration of having your umbrella flip upside down during a thunderstorm, or the way wet clothes hug your body so tightly that you waddle like a penguin.

- Remove Unnecessary Details: Good writing packs a tremendous amount of information in a small number of words. Tactically, start by removing intensifying words like “very” or “extremely.” As crutches of the English language, they reveal weaknesses in your prose. Then remove words that don’t move your argument forward. Sometimes, I pretend I’m hiring a translator. Most of them charge 10 cents per word, so you can save money by deleting superfluous. But the trick also inspires clarity. As Derek Sivers wrote: “If you can communicate the same idea with fewer words, it’s more likely to be read and understood. A sentence that’s easier to translate is also easier to understand.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1355518805/14591351)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/110377415) ^rw110377415
