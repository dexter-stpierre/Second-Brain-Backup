## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- By focusing on encapsulation, we make our functions focused, small and containing all the elements they need to do their job. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fmd83smwzqenxsrh01hyaxvr)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/248870994) ^rw248870994
    - Note: Encapsulating a functionality helps to keep function focused and clear. When you encapsulate functionality it makes it easier to read what each function is doing, testing is easier, and they tend to have clearer names so it is easier to read what is happening in the areas they are used in ^rw248870994-note

- I find if I have good functions, I don't always have to understand their details to know what's important to me at that given moment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fmd8htejc7cgah11x9bjf78a)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/248873858) ^rw248873858
    - Note: When using good functions that do a single thing and have a clear name you donâ€™t have to worry about the implementation details. You just have to know that they process the data in the way you need when you initially choose to use it after that you just need to trust that it continues to do so (which should be proven by tests) ^rw248873858-note
