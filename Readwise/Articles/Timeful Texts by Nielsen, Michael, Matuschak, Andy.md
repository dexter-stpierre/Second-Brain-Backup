- To be transformed by a book, readers must do more than absorb information: they must bathe in the book’s ideas, relate those ideas to experiences in their lives over weeks and months, try on the book’s mental models like a new hat. Unfortunately, readers must drive that process for themselves. Authors can’t easily guide this ongoing sense-making: their words are stuck on pages which have already been read. How might one create a medium which does the job of a book, but which escapes a book’s shackled sense of time? How might one create timeful texts—texts with affordances extending the authored experience over weeks and months, texts which continue the conversation with the reader as they slowly integrate those ideas into their lives?

    - Note: The Bible, and other religious texts, comes to mind as an example of texts that do this ^rw75281058-note

- As we consider alternative approaches, we can find inspiration in the world’s most transformative books. Consider texts like the Bible and the Analects of Confucius. People integrate ideas from those books into their lives over time—but not because authors designed them that way. Those books work because they’re surrounded by rich cultural activity. Weekly sermons and communities of practice keep ideas fresh in readers’ minds and facilitate ongoing connections to lived experiences. This is a powerful approach for powerful texts, requiring extensive investment from readers and organizers. We can’t build cathedrals for every book. Sophisticated readers adopt similar methods to study less exalted texts, but most people lack the necessary skills, drive, and cultural contexts. How might we design texts to more widely enable such practices? [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/75281059) ^rw75281059
    - Note: Great examples, but how do we do this for a common book that we read, not just "exalted texts"? How do we develop a natural pattern of "digging in" to books that influence us to create lasting change ^rw75281059-note

- To engage with a book’s ideas over time, readers must remember its details, and that’s already a challenge. One promising solution lies in spaced repetition memory systems, which allow users to retain large quantities of knowledge reliably and efficiently. Like meditation, these systems involve a daily practice: every day, a reader maintains their memory library by reviewing a few dozen lightweight prompts. Each prompt asks a detailed question, like “What types of stimuli does George Miller’s span of absolute judgment describe?” Each day’s session is different because each prompt repeats on its own schedule. When a user remembers or forgets the answer to a prompt, the system expands or contracts that prompt’s repetition interval along an exponential curve. These expanding intervals allow readers to maintain a collection of thousands of prompts while reviewing only a few dozen each day. Practitioners generally complete their review sessions in moments which would otherwise go unused, like when waiting in line. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/75281060) ^rw75281060
    - Note: Spaced repetition is an interesting concept, but I don't think just remembering information is the key to applying lessons from a text to your life. I think you need something more than that ^rw75281060-note

- As we interviewed readers, though, we noticed that the regular review sessions didn’t just build detailed retention: the ongoing practice also changed readers’ relationship to the material by maintaining their contact with it over time. These people didn’t just read the book once and proceed with their lives. Quantum Country’s review sessions returned readers to its ideas again and again over weeks and months.

- Consider The Elements of Style, a classic writing primer by Strunk and White. The authors demonstrate the value of parallel construction with this example from the Bible: “Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.” But it’s not enough to read an example. Good writers’ ears become automatically alert to these constructions. They notice opportunities to create parallelisms, and they notice dissonance when similar phrases are presented differently. It takes time to develop this awareness. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/75281062) ^rw75281062

- Of course, spaced repetition is just one approach for writing timeful texts. What other powerful tools might it be possible to create, making future books into artifacts that transcend their pages, as they slowly help readers shape their lives?
