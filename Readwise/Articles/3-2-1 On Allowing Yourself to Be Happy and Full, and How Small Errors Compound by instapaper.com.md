- “Books are more likely to change minds than conversations.
  There is too much happening internally during conversation:
  Did that sound stupid?
  What do they think of me?
  Will I lose the friendship over this opinion?
  Books can let you chew on an idea without social risk.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1394414092/15793131)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/156521010) ^rw156521010
    - Note: If trying to change someone’s mind recommending a book, article, or podcast is often better than a conversation. It allows them to consider an idea without embarrassment or feeling forced to state an opinion ^rw156521010-note
