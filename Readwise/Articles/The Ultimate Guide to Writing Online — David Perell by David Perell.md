- Invest in your future. Whether you want to become an author or an entrepreneur, you should start writing online. No matter what kind of book you want to write or what kind of company you want to start, it pays to have a smart and targeted audience. If you plan to write a book, writing online will help you develop a voice and land a publishing deal. And if you plan to start a company, writing will help you build credibility, meet investors, and find future co-founders. People under-estimate how much work is done before you start a company: that’s when you build your network, learn what you need to know, and discover what you’re good at. The seeds are planted years before the flowers bloom. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/60045328) ^rw60045328

- When you publish ideas, you create your own “Serendipity Vehicle” – a magnet for ideas and people and opportunities from potentially every corner of the globe. If your ideas resonate with people, people will discover you and bring you unexpected opportunities. They’ll open doors you never knew existed.

- Make it easy for people to find you. Buy a domain name and use it to create your own website, even if it’s very simple at first. Your website is your resume, your business card, your store, your directory, and your personal magazine. It’s the one place online that you completely own and control – your Online Home.

- When you first begin writing, before you publish anything, your website should have two things:
  A Start Here page
  A curated list of your favorite articles [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/60045332) ^rw60045332
    - Date:: [[May 13th, 2020, Wednesday]]
- Your Start Here page should answer routine visitor questions. Most readers want guidance, so give it to them. They’ll trust and appreciate your recommendations. After repeated visits, once they’ve followed your advice, they may take some risks and explore your website on their own. That’s when they’ll pore through the archives and see what you do for work. By making it easy on visitors when they first visit your website, you’ll make it easy for them to stick around and read your body of work.

- Building an audience is a chicken-and-egg problem: how do you create a substantial body of work that will attract visitors, before you have an audience to talk to? The prospect of publishing post after post and getting only crickets in response is daunting.
  Luckily, there’s a way to “bootstrap” your way to an audience: curation.
  When you’re just beginning, before you are recognized for your own ideas, curation works exceptionally well. It’s the fastest way to ignite a following and build a body of work. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/60045334) ^rw60045334

- Look, I get it. Writing on Medium is an easy way to pick up readers and increases your chances of going viral. But the costs exceed the benefits. Medium is terrible for SEO. You don’t own your content and the platform makes it difficult to turn one-time readers into loyal ones. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/60045335) ^rw60045335

- Most online writing advice falls into two schools of thought.
  One school encourages people to write anything and everything. It doesn’t matter what – they’ll tell you to put your head down, hit the keyboard, and ignore everything else. The other school sells hacks: always publish on Sunday at 6:08 pm, hire a freelancer to upvote your Reddit posts, and only write about what’s trending in the news.

- Do less. Concentrate your efforts. Commit to one platform and own it. Even if you write the best blog post in the world, if you don’t have a way to reach people, it won’t be seen. There are different strategies for succeeding on any given platform, but if you can build just one strong distribution channel, that’s all it takes to become a successful online writer. Focus on one platform, and as you build an audience, redirect those visitors to your website so you can grow your email list. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/60045337) ^rw60045337

- To be sure, distribution isn’t a replacement for publishing quality content. But the truth still stands: poor distribution, not poor content, is the most common reason why blogs don’t succeed. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/60045338) ^rw60045338

- Unlike social media, major corporations don't dominate email. Email reduces your dependency on volatile social media platforms, which makes it the best place to direct your efforts. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/60045339) ^rw60045339
    - Date:: [[May 13th, 2020, Wednesday]]
- When it comes to reader stickiness, nothing beats email. Nothing. Email is a direct distribution channel, which makes it sticky and valuable. People keep predicting the death of email, when in reality, it just keeps getting stronger. It’s a direct line to your most loyal and dedicated followers. People who sign up for your email list care about your ideas, and by putting in their email, they give you explicit permission to email them. Trying to build an online audience without an email list is a rookie mistake. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/60045340) ^rw60045340
    - Date:: [[May 13th, 2020, Wednesday]]
- Make it easy for people to sign up for your email list. Add a sign-up button on your website, but respect your guests and don’t ruin the usability of your site with annoying full-page pop-up banners. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/60045341) ^rw60045341

- To rank well on Google, you’ll need SEO (Search Engine Optimization). When you first launch your website, it will be almost invisible to Google and other search engines.. Google’s algorithm depends on trust, and building trust takes time. Links are the bedrock of SEO, and your SEO ranking will only rise once trusted websites start linking to it.

- Building an audience takes time. It’s a slow process, but don’t let that fact turn you off. That’s what makes having an audience so powerful. An audience is valuable because it takes time to build. If it happened quickly, it wouldn’t be a sustainable advantage. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/60045343) ^rw60045343

- The easiest way to write more is to write about ideas that stimulate you. If you do, you’ll be able to produce on a more consistent basis. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/60045345) ^rw60045345

- The best online writers are driven by five pillars: (1) evergreen content, (2) quality, (3) specificity, (4) listening to feedback, and (5) building a body of work. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/60275579) ^rw60275579

- 1. Write Evergreen Content [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/60275580) ^rw60275580
    - Date:: [[May 14th, 2020, Thursday]]
- Writing about the right topics is as important as writing well. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/60275581) ^rw60275581
    - Date:: [[May 14th, 2020, Thursday]]
- Evergreen articles are the foundation of most successful blogs because they stay relevant and can generate traffic for years and years. If an idea won’t be valuable three years after you publish it, don’t write about it. Prioritizing evergreen articles is the single best constraint you can give yourself. By writing evergreen pieces, you’ll attract loyal and intelligent readers who can trust that your writing won’t lose value as their eyes scroll down the page.

- Once you’ve committed to writing evergreen articles, you can explore other aspects of the ideation process. I like Devon Zuegel’s idea that writing falls into three buckets. She first told me about it when I interviewed her on The North Star Podcast:
  "As Devon Zuegel said in my interview with her, writing falls into three buckets: (1) trivial things that everybody knows, (2) things that everybody knows, [but nobody around you knows], and you have a unique perspective on, and (3) stuff that nobody knows so you have to do tons of research. Direct your energy towards the second bucket.” [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/60275583) ^rw60275583

    - Date:: [[May 14th, 2020, Thursday]]
- To succeed as a writer on the Internet, you will have to unlearn the pillars of your middle school education. Avoid SAT words. Use simple ones instead. There are no word limits, and you can write about whatever you want. Style is important, but substance matters more. The better your ideas and the clearer you can express them, the better your writing will be. It’s that simple. Everything else is secondary. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/60275585) ^rw60275585
    - Date:: [[May 14th, 2020, Thursday]]
- Copywriters are masters of the written word. They write with clarity, energy, and simplicity, which is exactly what readers on the Internet are looking for. They write in specifics, not generalities. There’s no fluff. They get straight to the point. By writing in a persuasive, outcome-oriented (instead of academic) style, copywriters provoke responses and feedback. They rewrite and rewrite, and only hit publish once they’ve said what they wanted to say in the fewest possible words. In short, most people would improve their writing more by emulating copywriters instead of heeding the advice of famous novelists. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/60275586) ^rw60275586
    - Date:: [[May 14th, 2020, Thursday]]
- The easiest way to add rhythm to your writing is to vary sentence length. Short sentences speed things up, and long sentences slooooooowwwwww things down. First, you should write a long sentence whenever you have a lot to say about a topic, and when you can put together a string of connected ideas that flow well together and collectively build up to the broader point you’re trying to make. Then, you stop. You shorten your sentences, so you can make your point. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/60275587) ^rw60275587
    - Date:: [[May 14th, 2020, Thursday]]
- 3. Be Specific [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/60275588) ^rw60275588
    - Date:: [[May 14th, 2020, Thursday]]
- Unfortunately, online metrics highlight page views over other, more meaningful measures. Resist the temptation to focus only on page views. If you write for page views, you’ll end up watering down your ideas for the masses, which will result in boring posts that intelligent people won’t want to read. Instead of trying to reach as many people as possible, try to tap into one narrow vein of interest that nobody else is addressing in quite the same way as you. The true magic of the Internet is its ability to attract like-minded people from far-flung places, who you’d never be able to meet otherwise.

    - Date:: [[May 14th, 2020, Thursday]]
- Build a targeted audience. The more narrow and niche the topic, the better. Attracting the right people matters much more than the number of people who read your work. Intelligent readers want depth, nuance, and specificity. Speak their language, and ignore the temptation to write for the lowest common denominator.

- 4. Listen to Feedback [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/60275592) ^rw60275592
    - Date:: [[May 14th, 2020, Thursday]]
- The fastest way to improve the quality of your work is to accelerate your feedback loops. More feedback is generally better. Online writers benefit from copious amounts of feedback. As a prolific online writer, I have a treasure trove of data about what people are interested in and what they ignore. With it, I can provide a better experience for my readers.

    - Date:: [[May 14th, 2020, Thursday]]
- You’re already processing a large volume of ideas through your everyday experience: with the social media updates you post, the books and articles you read, the emails you send, the conversations you have, and the meetings you attend. By consuming, digesting, and sharing these ideas with peers and colleagues, you’re already building expertise. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/60275595) ^rw60275595
    - Date:: [[May 14th, 2020, Thursday]]
- If you want to build an audience, you need to refine your ideas and change how you distribute the ideas you’re already thinking about. Instead of creating new ideas, you should save and redirect the flow of your existing ones. Once you’ve developed a system for publishing at a consistent pace, you can turn your attention to building a body of work. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/60275596) ^rw60275596

- Networking events are overrated. The Internet makes the bar-and-conference style of networking obsolete. Writing on the Internet is the most effective way to meet peers and colleagues like yourself. Skip the networking events and devote that time to writing instead.

- Unlike the time you spend at networking events, the benefits of writing online compound over time. Like any smart investment, it builds on itself. Write something once and you can share it for the rest of your life. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/60571416) ^rw60571416

- Pick a small, but ever-growing market and learn everything you can about it. Build expertise before the other settlers arrive. Then, share everything you learn. If you can create a body of work before the wave of popularity arrives, you’ll be well positioned to capitalize on it when other people are looking for an authority.

- Personal Monopolies let you turn ideas into wealth. As James Dale Davidson wrote in The Sovereign Individual:
  “Merit, wherever it arises, will be rewarded as never before. In an environment where the greatest source of wealth will be the ideas you have in your head rather than physical capital alone, anyone who thinks clearly will be potentially rich. The Information Age will be the age of upward mobility. It will afford far more equal opportunity for the billions of human in parts of the world that never shared fully in the prosperity of industrial society. The brightest, most successful and ambitious of these will emerge as truly Sovereign Individuals.” [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/61316530) ^rw61316530

- Advertising your unique skill set is the best way to attract high-value opportunities. You don’t get paid for what you think you’re worth; you get paid for what other people think you’re worth. It’s how markets work. It’s hard to command a price premium for your work when your skills are easy to learn or overlap with millions of other people.
