- Polarised thinking, also called “splitting” or “all-or-nothing” thinking, is a type of cognitive distortion that prevents people from formulating and understanding some nuanced statements. It’s a common defence mechanism. Usually, the statements in question have deep personal relevance to the person.

    - Note: Sometimes beliefs we hold are held so strongly that we forget why we even hold them, but we never forget how important they are to us. However, this isn’t constructive in a dialogue ^rw135534393-note

- As clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst Jennifer Kunst puts it: “The more invested we are in our point of view as being right—morally or intellectually or practically superior—the more difficult it is to listen to another’s point of view. The more invested we are in viewing the other person as wrong—silly or ridiculous or stupid or bad—the more difficult it is to compromise, change, and find a way out or a way through.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365211867/15281519)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/135534394) ^rw135534394

- By failing to practice nuanced thinking, polarised thinkers are often faced with a gap between reality—which is much more complex than an “all-or-nothing” statement can capture—and their perception of reality. This gap often results in further radicalisation. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1365211867/15281525)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/135534395) ^rw135534395
    - Note: The more we fail to address the gap between reality and the way we perceive it the bigger we make that gap by digging into our ungrounded beliefs ^rw135534395-note

- We often create artificial divisions between two ideas and we represent them as being opposed or completely different. ... Consider additional options that may not contradict the existing two options, or consider whether these two options are truly incompatible, or whether they lie on a spectrum instead.

- Evidence from a single event rarely translates to all events. Try to consider the context within which you are evaluating an idea. ... Make sure your sample size is large enough to draw a conclusion, and consider phrasing your statements in a more nuanced way (“I’m fairly confident that…” or “I think that in some cases…”).

- Nuanced thinking is not always necessary—it’s okay to use rules of thumb when making small decisions—but it’s important to practice so we can have more constructive conversations.
