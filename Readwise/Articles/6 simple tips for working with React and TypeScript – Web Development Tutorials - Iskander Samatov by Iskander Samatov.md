## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- One way to create new types is by using the TypeScript utility types.

    - Note: When the author says utility types they are referring to built ins like `Omit` and `Partial`. Not sure if they are also referring to custom generics like my `
      ApiResponse` type ^rw270640536-note

- `React.CSSProperties` is a type that represents style information in React for CSS-in-JS objects. This type is useful for passing the `style` prop to your components and making sure that it’s used in a way that’s supported by React.

    - Note: Using this type to create a style object outside of the JSX is a useful tip ^rw270643217-note

- If you’re looking for TypeScript declarations for a third-party module but can’t seem to find any, you can either create your own types or turn off type checking for this module using [shorthand ambient modules](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Handbook/blob/master/pages/Modules.md#shorthand-ambient-modules) ([View Highlight](https://isamatov.com/react-typescript-tips?__readwiseLocation=0%2F83%2F11%2F3%2F3%2F1%2F3%3A0%2C0%2F1%2F83%2F11%2F3%2F3%2F1%2F3%3A28#:~:text=If%20you%E2%80%99re%20looking%20for%20TypeScript%2C%0A%20%20shorthand%20ambient%20modules)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/270644099) ^rw270644099
    - Note: This is how we get around type declarations to .txt and .svg files ^rw270644099-note
