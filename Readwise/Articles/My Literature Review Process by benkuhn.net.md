- It’s important to maintain your set of papers in some sort of organized format, so that you can easily keep track of the big picture, and quickly add new papers to your analysis. For instance, I kept a spreadsheet of all the papers I found on donation matching so that I could just copy-paste some cells to run calculations on new papers.

    - Note: Keep your sources organized in a ormat that is easy to add to and has all relevant details in one place ^rw87183341-note

- In addition to a spreadsheet, I also kept PDFs and notes on the papers in Evernote. When I published the analysis, I hosted my own copy of all the papers I relied on, and linked to those in addition to external versions (see the bibliography). I strongly recommend this, since links to papers on other sites may break without your knowledge and make your analysis hard to verify or reproduce.

    - Note: Keep your own copies of sources. Mine tend to live right here in Instapaper ^rw87183342-note

- Finally, if your literature review involves code or calculations that you perform yourself, you should make these available for review as well. If you’re willing to learn a new program, I’d recommend using Git and putting everything up open-source on Github. Git and Github are great general-purpose tools for managing different versions and updates to files: it’s easy to make changes, incorporate other people’s suggestions, and see how the analysis has changed over time.This makes your analysis much more transparent.

    - Note: Keep code version controlled and in an open format. You can keep the code private while working on the paper, but make the code public when you publish ^rw87183344-note

- I generally take a less systematic approach. I’ll look through the first few pages of Google Scholar for a bunch of relevant searches, taking note of any papers that look relevant, until I think I’m hitting diminishing returns. Then as I read those papers I’ll take note of any citations that seem like they might also be worth including. This seems to find most or all of the available papers. It’s somewhat more prone to bias, since it’s less well-defined than the keyword-search approach, but I don’t think that’s a huge issue if you’re diligent about it.

    - Note: Use the citations of sources to find more sources ^rw87183345-note

- Hopefully, at this point you have some idea what “the big picture” is. Try to describe it clearly. It’s kind to your readers if this section can stand alone so that readers can skip the analysis and spot-check it later. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/87183346) ^rw87183346
    - Note: Giving your readers a section where they can get the gist of your write up respects their time and ensures that you spend time thinking about what really matters about your review. If you can’t create a good write up odds are that you haven’t done enough research or the focus of your paper is too broad ^rw87183346-note
