- distractions aren’t just unproductive, they’re anti-productive. They create more work than they replace. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1418448713/16612385)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/188500435) ^rw188500435

- the first and most important goal of an attention diet should be to consciously limit the number of distractions we’re exposed to. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1418448713/16612411)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/188500436) ^rw188500436
    - Note: I feel like I need to do better at this. I should hide Twitter feed and Facebook feed using that extension so they are less of distractions ^rw188500436-note

- That then raises the question, “What stuff is worth paying attention to?” What should we give a fuck about? ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1418448713/16612413)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/188500437) ^rw188500437

- in a world with infinite information and opportunity, you don’t grow by knowing or doing more, you grow by the ability to correctly focus on less. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1418448713/16612458)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/188500440) ^rw188500440
    - Note: Having a high degree of focus on your most important areas is more beneficial than having little focus on all the areas that don’t really matter to you ^rw188500440-note

- There are three steps to the Attention Diet:
  Correctly identify nutritious information and relationships.
  Cut out the junk information and relationships.
  Cultivate habits of deeper focus and a longer attention span. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1418448713/16612466)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/188500441) ^rw188500441

- Junk information is information that is unreliable, unhelpful, or unimportant (i.e., it affects few to no people in any significant way). Junk information is short-form, flashy, and emotionally charged, encouraging addictive consumption patterns.

- Nutritious information is information that is reliable, helpful, and likely important (i.e., it affects you and others in significant ways). Nutritious information is long-form, analytical, and encourages deep engagement and extended thought.

    - Date:: [[June 7th, 2021, Monday]]
- Junk relationships are people/groups who you have little face-to-face contact with and/or little mutual trust, who bring out your insecurities and consistently make you feel worse about yourself or the world.

- Nutritious connections are people/groups who you have frequent face-to-face contact with and/or a lot of mutual trust who make you feel better and help you grow. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1418448713/16612487)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/188500445) ^rw188500445

- There are two benefits of limiting yourself to long-form content. The first is that (on average) it’s going to portray far more research, nuance, and thought than short-form content. Stupidity in a tweet can sound deep. Stupidity repeated for 12,000 words quickly makes itself apparent.

    - Date:: [[June 9th, 2021, Wednesday]]
- The second benefit of long-form content is that it hones our attention span and gets us accustomed to sitting with topics for extended periods of time. It helps us to not fall prey to our immediate knee-jerk responses. It gives us the space to wonder, “What if my assumption is wrong? What if I’m the one with dick breath in this argument?” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1418448713/16625826)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/188962941) ^rw188962941
    - Note: Sticking with long form content also ensures that you don’t learn about tons of topics in a super shallow manner ^rw188962941-note

- In Everything is Fucked: A Book About Hope, I redefine freedom as self-limitation. Freedom in the 21st century isn’t about having more, it’s about choosing your commitments to less.

- without realizing it, the constant stimulation of our phones and social media and video games and Netflix series have robbed us of the creative energies of our own boredom.

- Boredom is good. It means you’re challenging yourself. It’s like bicep curls for your mind. Embrace the boredom. Bathe in the boredom. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1418448713/16626050)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/188970599) ^rw188970599

- You are always missing out. You always were and always will be. The question is: what is it that you are choosing to miss out on? ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1418448713/16626058)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/188970600) ^rw188970600
    - Note: This would have been a heavy realization for a younger Dexter ^rw188970600-note

- Most of your life, you didn’t care that you were missing out because you either weren’t aware that you were missing out or you were missing out on things you knew didn’t matter to you. Social media fucks up both of those—it makes you aware of everything, and it also gives you the false perception that things are way more important than they are.
