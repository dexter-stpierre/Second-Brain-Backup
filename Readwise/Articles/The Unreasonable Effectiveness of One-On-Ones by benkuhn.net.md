## Highlights

- Most graduate students, including Eve, start school right after college, i.e., without much clue about how to effectively do self-directed work. At high-functioning organizations, people try pretty hard to support recent college graduates by teaching them how to prioritize, avoid getting stuck, and generally be effective at things that are more complicated than “do well on the next exam.” In many grad school departments, on the other hand, you’re lucky to meet with your adviser (the only person who nominally cares) more than once a month. Since I also cared, and apparently was more available, I decided to try to help. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85534701) ^rw85534701

- At Wave, I’ve had one-on-ones with my manager since the time I joined, and I found them incredibly useful for helping me improve at work. Different people would spend their one-on-ones on different topics, but for example, mine often included: [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85534702) ^rw85534702

- Personal habits and self-improvements. Among other things, by talking through how to improve my focus, I quickly got 50% more productive time (and that’s just the part that was easy to measure). [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85534703) ^rw85534703

- Project management. We’d often post-mortem recent projects. Even though I was building software, the improvement points here were mostly non-technical (e.g.: a different part of this project turned out to be the riskiest part and should have been done first, or we should have checked in more frequently with some stakeholder).

- In addition to improving the form of my communication, I also learned a lot about how to improve my communication habits (e.g. when to communicate how much)—this was extra important since Wave is a distributed company, and has different norms that take some getting used to.

- Uncertainties. The founders always encouraged me to use 1-on-1s to ask about anything I was uncertain about, even if it didn’t affect my day-to-day work. If anything, I spend more attention worrying about things that don’t affect my day-to-day work (because those are the things I can’t control), so I’d often end up a lot less stressed after these discussions. For the founders, I think these discussions helped them discover problems with internal communication—for instance, occasionally I’d get worried about some strategically important project elsewhere in the company because they’d forgotten to announce progress reports on it.

- The last thing this helped me realize is that specialists have a lot of non-specialized problems. In one sense, this is so well known it’s become a cliché—the engineer who just wants to crank out code all day, the philosophy professor with their head in the clouds. But the cliché doesn’t really describe me or most engineers or philosophers I know, who are broad-minded enough to be happy thinking about things outside our assigned specialty. Even for us, though, we can often increase our impact a lot by improving our generalized effectiveness. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85534707) ^rw85534707
