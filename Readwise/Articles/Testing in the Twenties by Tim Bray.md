## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- there are lots of branches in that trail of tears. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fv90mcyw4hqmqfc991cv3c2c)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/283454870) ^rw283454870
    - Note: Yeah, let's not use that as a mtaphor please ✌️ ^rw283454870-note

- Untested legacy code bases can and should be improved incrementally ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fv90qfg23s22ryh29167nnnh)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/283455184) ^rw283455184

- Unit tests empower code reviewers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fv90r46k4fnjd611pdabbd8g)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/283455329) ^rw283455329
    - Note: Huh, this is an interesting thought. When I can review code and see a test that accompanies the code that they wrote I can ask what happens in cases that aren't covered by tests. Or hopefully the cases that I am worried about are covered by tests and I don't have to worry about them ^rw283455329-note

- code is read and updated way more often than it’s written. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fv90yvbm985jvtctbze1xv47)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/283455550) ^rw283455550

- Here’s a policy I’ve seen applied successfully; It has two parts: First, when you make any significant change to a function that doesn’t have unit tests, write them. Second, no check-in is allowed to make the coverage numbers go down. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fv927v3epzpcdk8wmbwe1r63)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/283460568) ^rw283460568
    - Note: This is a reasonable policy that I think we could implement and see improvements in our code without undo stress ^rw283460568-note

- Testing should be an ultimately-pragmatic activity with no room for ideology. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fv92dnm360qvwc0xykc126qj)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/283461793) ^rw283461793

- I’m not sure the difference between “integration” and “end-to-end” matters, though. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fv9336rcw2ps2hbg52w4w2kb)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/283465370) ^rw283465370
