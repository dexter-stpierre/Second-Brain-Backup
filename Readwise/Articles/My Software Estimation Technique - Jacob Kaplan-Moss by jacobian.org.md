## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- An estimate that only includes time implies a high degree of certainty: if you tell me “that will take 10 days”, and we have a deadline 14 days out, I’ll assume we’re in great shape. If, on the other hand, we have that same deadline but you tell me “that will take 10-15 days”, now I know our deadline is at risk.

### Break down the work into less complex tasks
- The first part of almost any estimation technique is to break work down into smaller tasks based on complexity. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1437028387/17251087)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/216660442) ^rw216660442

- To some degree these names and numbers are arbitrary (though, you should pick a scale and stick with it long-term so that you can ). ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1437028387/17251091)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/216660443) ^rw216660443
    - Note: Using a consistent scale helps to determine your accuracy over time ^rw216660443-note

- Use real wall-clock hours and days, not idealized “programmer days” that assume engineers will write code 8 hours a day. That is, in the above system a small task is something that really will take about 4 hours, accounting for all the other things an engineer has to deal with during a normal workday ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1437028387/17251154)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/216660444) ^rw216660444

- Try to capture realistic expected times. Don’t be overly optimistic and go with “best-case” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1437028387/17251273)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/216677334) ^rw216677334

- my uncertainty system starts with the expected time (captured above), and then applies an “if-things-go-wrong” multiplier ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1437028387/17251355)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/216677335) ^rw216677335

- the next step is to capture that uncertainty. Initially, you might think of capturing a best-case and worst-case scenario, but I don’t find that too useful. Instead, I prefer to capture expected-case and worst-case. Coming in early is never a problem, and in my experience, the best-case rarely happens. But it is important to capture how long something could take if things go poorly.

- The “multiplier” here is a scale factor I apply to the length to get a pessimistic estimate. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1437028387/17251359)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/216677337) ^rw216677337

- if you’re dealing with a too-uncertain estimate, or one that needs to be broken down further, you can trade some time up-front for a better estimate. Taking a week or two to produce a better estimate can be a much better idea than embarking down an uncertain path with crossed fingers.

- be sure you’re tracking actual time, as the project goes on. This forms a feedback loop: you make a projection, observe how much it deviates from reality, and you can use that knowledge to refine and train your estimation skills over time.

- I don’t much see the point in best-case estimates – but it seems good. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1437028387/17251431)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/216677340) ^rw216677340
    - Note: I think best case estimates helps you know if you are predicting that best case scenario well instead of thinking that you are estimating way too high ^rw216677340-note
