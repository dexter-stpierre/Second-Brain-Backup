## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- It sounds crazy, but as I thought through all my old projects, I realized the dead projects had something surprising in common: I abandoned them about two weeks after starting. Almost every side project I completed was something I finished in under two weeks. Two weeks seemed to be when my motivation ran out. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85302952) ^rw85302952

- If I couldn’t complete the project in two weeks, it wasn’t worth attempting. As much as I was in love with the vision, I had to look at the entire project with this lens. So what gets the axe? [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85302953) ^rw85302953

- First I had to be clear about the *real* problem I was trying to solve. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85302954) ^rw85302954

- Even for the remaining features I tried to keep cutting scope. For every bit of work I’d ask myself: Do I really need to have this? Is there a simpler way I can achieve the same goal? [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85302955) ^rw85302955

- Sometimes the scope cuts were much more subtle. Some steps which might be best practices at work are unnecessary bloat at home. To know which is which, think about why it’s a best practice in the first place. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85302956) ^rw85302956

- And every project was useful. I’d designed the motion sensor and telegram bot to be independent of the exact application I was developing. Now in any of my future projects I’ll be able to reuse those components if needed, saving me days of work and letting me complete more ambitious projects in that same two week period. I have new tools in my tool belt. That’s still a win! [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85302957) ^rw85302957
