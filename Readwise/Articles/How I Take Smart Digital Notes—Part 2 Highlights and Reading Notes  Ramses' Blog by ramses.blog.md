## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- I always had the feeling I was learning something by reading, but I had nothing to show. Every time I had a conversation about an idea I had read recently, I would blank on the details. Revisiting books was a daily ritual, simply to ingrain the concepts.

    - Note: This is how I feel for sure ^rw178153318-note

- Precisely because of my reading system, I can retain what I read. My approach also allows me to build on the ideas I store in my second brain, progressively gaining more insight.

    - Note: Gaining more insight is something that I want for sure ^rw178153319-note
    - Date:: [[May 12th, 2021, Wednesday]]
- I see reading as an investment; I trade time and energy to become better in the future. But without proper techniques, my effort is wasted. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181465/16362221)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178168655) ^rw178168655

- “By standardizing and streamlining both the format of our notes and the steps by which we process them, the real work can come to the forefront: thinking, reflecting, writing, discussing, testing, and sharing. This is the work that adds value, and now we have the time to do it more effectively.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181465/16362236)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178168656) ^rw178168656
    - Note: Deciding how to organize isn’t the important work you are trying to do, it is simply a tool to help you do the work. By deciding how things should be organized ahead of time it free mental power to do the real work of think, writing, reflecting, or whatever else you are trying to do ^rw178168656-note

- Most articles, books, and other writing contain a lot of fluff. At most, 10% is worth keeping. That’s what you’ll want to highlight. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181465/16362297)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178168657) ^rw178168657
    - Note: Finding the most valuable parts of a text is the key to good highlighting ^rw178168657-note

- Collecting interesting bits is only part of the story. You also need to cultivate the mindset of a curator. Carefully choose what you read; make strategic choices for your information diet. Ask yourself with everything you highlight: “Am I highlighting this because it truly resonates with me, or because I think ‘I should know this’?" ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181465/16362311)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178168658) ^rw178168658
    - Note: I think it is worth highlighting things that I think “I should know” if there is still a purpose for it. Am I trying to track certain trends in the news? Something may not particularly resonate with me but might still be important to understanding an overall trend ^rw178168658-note

- What helps me not highlight too much or too little is to do several passes of the text. I first skim by looking at the structure, headings, and images—I build a mental map of what I’m about to read. Next, I read the text once and make a mental note of interesting bits. Last, I reread and mark up the things I want to remember. This is not how I approach everything; sometimes, I only skim and then highlight directly. What guides me is how important the text is and if I need to remember what’s in it (= more passes).

    - Note: If something is a more critical piece for a project then it probably deserves a more thorough passes with more readings and a deferred highlighting. Something like daily newsletters probably only warrent a skim and highlighting while doing so ^rw178168659-note

- Before I knew what to highlight, I would often capture way too much. My Evernote had become a dumping ground of mostly irrelevant notes, which caused me never to reference them. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181465/16362332)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178168660) ^rw178168660
    - Note: I feel like I do this sometimes ^rw178168660-note

- the purpose of highlighting on paper: to pick out important parts and make review easier. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181465/16362342)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178168661) ^rw178168661
    - Date:: [[May 12th, 2021, Wednesday]]
- On paper, you always have the context, so it’s not necessary to mark entire paragraphs. Limit yourself to just a few words here and there to draw your attention. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181465/16362370)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178168662) ^rw178168662
    - Note: I wonder if this would be a good practice for my specific case since I turn my paper highlights into digital ones with Readwise. Because of this the digital ones are honestly easier to get context on since the whole article is usually only 2 or so clicks away and I typically save the entire source before highlighting ^rw178168662-note
    - Date:: [[May 12th, 2021, Wednesday]]
- you can write questions below subheadings and mark the answer in the corresponding paragraphs. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181465/16362380)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178168663) ^rw178168663
    - Note: This could be an interesting practice to start. It would be cool to find the answers as I go and if I don’t get them all answered then I have another question to start doing research into ^rw178168663-note
    - Date:: [[May 12th, 2021, Wednesday]]
- Change headings into questions, highlight the answer in the corresponding paragraph. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181465/16362413)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178188948) ^rw178188948
    - Note: This is a great way to interact deeply with the text and ensure that you are following with the author and learning the things that they are trying to teach you ^rw178188948-note
    - Date:: [[May 12th, 2021, Wednesday]]
- You should be able only to read the highlights and understand the concept. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181465/16362417)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178188949) ^rw178188949
    - Note: HIghlights are simply pulling out the most important parts of a text. If you read only your highlights you should get the entire main idea of the text ^rw178188949-note
    - Date:: [[May 12th, 2021, Wednesday]]
- digital highlights tend to lack context because they’re often exported to note-taking apps. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181465/16362448)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178188950) ^rw178188950
    - Note: There tends to be very little difference in my workflow since I bring paper notes into Roam ^rw178188950-note
    - Date:: [[May 12th, 2021, Wednesday]]
- For digital extracts, I keep the principle of atomicity in mind. Atomicity is the same principle I hold myself to when taking notes; every note should contain one idea and be understood on its own. Likewise, all my highlights explain exactly one concept that I can understand without any additional context. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181465/16362455)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178188951) ^rw178188951
    - Note: This is a great method to do. Ensuring that your highlights can be understood independently from each other makes sure that when you use them you have everything you need ^rw178188951-note
    - Date:: [[May 12th, 2021, Wednesday]]
- Readwise tags are not just for sorting; they are also to stitch together highlights. If you add the note .c1 to a snippet and .c2 to another, the two will become one highlight. This enables me only to take the useful bits and leave out the rest. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181465/16362462)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178188952) ^rw178188952
    - Note: This is a habit that I need to get in the habit of. Being able to take only the context I want and not the fluff would be very useful ^rw178188952-note
    - Date:: [[May 12th, 2021, Wednesday]]
- You don’t learn if you don’t understand. Highlighting gives the illusion of understanding because the explanation is laid out in front of you. But when you take away the text, how well can you explain the ideas? Chances are, you’ll fail miserably. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181465/16362484)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178188953) ^rw178188953
    - Note: Taking notes helps to ensure you understand a concept by forcing you to put it in your own words. Having the information in fron of you makes you feel like you understand but when you have to write about it you can clearly tell if you do truly understand. Defaulting to the exact words you just read? You probably don’t have a very good understanding ^rw178188953-note
    - Date:: [[May 12th, 2021, Wednesday]]
- Make no mistake, writing notes while reading definitely slows me down. The upside is that I much better retain what I read. Because I need to find the words to describe the idea to myself, I’m processing it on a much deeper level. By trying to find the right words, many related ideas will cross my mind, which provides a latticework to hang the new ideas on. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181465/16362498)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178188954) ^rw178188954
    - Note: I would rather retain the information that I am learning and connect it to other pieces of knowledge than just blaze through tons of information ^rw178188954-note
    - Date:: [[May 12th, 2021, Wednesday]]
- Like my highlights, every note is atomic in the sense that it contains one idea that can be understood on its own. To provide extra context, I usually read digitally and attach my notes to parts I’ve highlighted—this also allows me to reference the section that triggered the thought. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181465/16362512)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178188955) ^rw178188955
    - Note: I want to start writing out atomic notes like this. Maybe I could start with my idea for a blog series on job hunt tracking. It is mostly relating to my personal experience, but I’m sure I’ll pull in other notes ^rw178188955-note
    - Date:: [[May 12th, 2021, Wednesday]]
- We encounter most ideas more than once, and much of what we save is not even relevant at the moment. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181465/16362527)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178188956) ^rw178188956
    - Note: I feel like I surbumb to a scarcity mindset with information. I always worry that if I don’t save something I will never come across it again. But in all reality I will probably read the same book or article again, or one that brings up the same idea ^rw178188956-note
    - Date:: [[May 12th, 2021, Wednesday]]
- Having a set of challenges in mind that you want to learn for is an excellent filter to not jump on every idea. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181465/16362532)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178188957) ^rw178188957
    - Note: Knowing the exact thing that you are trying to learn is a great way to filter down the information you keep to only those that are truly relevant ^rw178188957-note
