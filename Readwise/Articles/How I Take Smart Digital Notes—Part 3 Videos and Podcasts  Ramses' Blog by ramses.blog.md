## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- The funny thing about online course creators is that they like to slam college education, but they’re basically offering a light-weight version of the real thing. Courses with live cohorts are selling you lectures where they talk through a few slides and allow you to ask questions.

    - Note: Basically the same thing as the college courses that the slam. I guess the the stipulation that they are maybe teaching a niche concept that wouldn’t be taught in school ^rw178199248-note

- Online courses do have an upside; they can record everything and offer it for playback. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411182301/16363351)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178199249) ^rw178199249
    - Note: Being able to review a course is a huge benefit ^rw178199249-note

- Don’t take too many notes during live calls. Instead, participate in the discussion, ask questions, and only jot down the essentials. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411182301/16363363)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178199250) ^rw178199250
    - Note: Jot down ideas that are sure to be built upon and questions ^rw178199250-note

- I prefer the outline method, which is writing one short idea per bullet point. I nest related concepts under the main nodes. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411182301/16363384)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178199251) ^rw178199251
    - Note: The nice thing about Roam is that you can even attach an idea to a sub point in a completely different area with block references. Nothing needs to live in only one place ^rw178199251-note

- Timestamps allow me to revisit ideas in short bursts without skipping through the video to find what I’m looking for. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411182301/16363422)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178199252) ^rw178199252
    - Note: Using timestamps is an easy way to be able to revist the part of the video you referenced. Youtube is easy to add timestamps to. The one bummer of Youtube is that you can’t have a backup in case the original video is taken down ^rw178199252-note
