## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- The core idea of Smart Notes is that purely extracting highlights is generally a waste of time. A highlight speaks to you when you take it, but if you don't capture the idea that the highlight gave you, you're unlikely to remember the importance of that highlight later. Or even if you do feel some spark when revisiting the highlight, it might be a different interpretation. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85534716) ^rw85534716

- ...the mere copying of quotes almost always changes their meaning by stripping them out of context, even though the words aren't changed. This is a common beginner mistake, which can only lead to a patchwork of ideas, but never a coherent thought. (Page 75) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85534717) ^rw85534717

- Instead of simply highlighting passages, the Smart Notes system encourages you to manually create notes of the ideas you get as you read. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85534718) ^rw85534718
    - Note: I need to start taking notes of why I highlight something. I don’t want to lose the valuable context of why something stuck out to me ^rw85534718-note

- Since reading How to Take Smart Notes I've been adopting the Zettlekasten method in my own reading, and I can see how it's improving on an already strong note-taking process. By adding my own contextual notes to my highlights, and taking time after finishing a book to process and better organize those notes, I'm able to generate more ideas as I read and put those ideas to better use. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85534719) ^rw85534719
    - Note: Do I want to review the notes right after I finish reading? Doing so would allow me to still be in the head space from that book. However waiting a week or two might allow me to catch new insights that I wouldn’t if I still had my idea of what I read in my mind ^rw85534719-note

- But why physical notes? When you have to write your notes by hand, you'll be a bit more thoughtful with them and be forced to put things in your own words. With typing, it's easier to just re-type what you're reading (or worse, copy & paste), and not capture the whole context of the idea. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85534720) ^rw85534720
    - Note: Could be interesting to take notes physically for books. This would avoid me having to use the crappy Kindle keyboard. I think for articles I am good with digital notes, typing things out on my phone/computer is a good experience and it will allow me to keep the same work flow if I am reading articles on my phone while on the go ^rw85534720-note

- Handwriting makes pure copying impossible, but instead facilitates the translation of what is said (or written) into one's own words. The students who typed into their laptops were much quicker, which enabled them to copy the lecture more closely but circumvented actual understanding. They focused on completeness. Verbatim notes can be taken with almost no thinking, as if the words are taking a short cut from the ear to the hand, bypassing the brain. (Page 78) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85534721) ^rw85534721
    - Note: I don’t want to miss out on the opportnity to learn as much as I can ^rw85534721-note

- Keep it very short, be extremely selective, and use your own words. Be extra selective with quotes don't copy them to skip the step of really understanding what they mean. (Page 24) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85534722) ^rw85534722
    - Note: Making myself write out a note when I highlight something makes the selection process easier. If I am not willing to write something quick then I probably didn’t get enough out of the passage to highlight it ^rw85534722-note

- The important question here is: how can I make this idea detailed enough to stand on its own, without the context of the book or the associated highlight? You want each of these ideas to be fully formed thoughts that you can reference in a bunch of different areas later. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85534723) ^rw85534723
    - Note: This is a key to taking what I am learning and turning it into evergreen notes ^rw85534723-note

- In the old system, the question is: Under which topic do I store this note? In the new system, the question is: In which context will I want to stumble on it again? (Page 40) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85534724) ^rw85534724
    - Note: The practice of note taking isn’t to benefit yourself in this moment, it’s to benefit your future self ^rw85534724-note

- First, I'll tag each idea with the book I got it from. This just makes sure that once I move it, I'll know where it originally came from. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85534725) ^rw85534725
    - Note: Maybe using block references would allow me to keep it in place without worrying about forgetting where it came from ^rw85534725-note

- Step 4: File Your Notes [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85534726) ^rw85534726
    - Note: I still how I lot of questions about how exactly I want to file my notes. Moving them to a page for a topic as suggested in this article still feels like the folder/file way to do it ^rw85534726-note
