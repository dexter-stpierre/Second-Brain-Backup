## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- Know your purpose. It’s easy to get distracted during a conversation. Try to make sure that every question you ask helps you gather either facts or your interlocutor’s opinion. Avoid empty questions to fill the time. Genuinely try to know more about them, and frame your questions accordingly.

    - Note: When you have a purpose behind talking with someone align your questions to your purpose. This will help you avoid questions that are boring and counterproductive ^rw103028787-note

- Start by listening. In the classic How to Win Friends and Influence People, Dale Carnegie advised to “be a good listener” and to “ask questions the other person will enjoy answering.” More than eighty years later, his advice still holds true. You can’t ask good questions if you don’t listen to what the person has to say.

    - Note: Ask questions about the thing that the other person loves. When they answer questions about their most important interests their answers will be enthusiastic and will lead to additional questions ^rw103028788-note

- Interrupt wisely. It’s not about never interrupting the person you’re chatting with. It’s about ending fewer sentences with a period, and more with a question mark. Don’t worry about asking the wrong question. Not asking enough is more detrimental to building a relationship than asking one poorly phrased question.

    - Note: Ask clarifying questions. If you don’t understand something ask for clarification. Ask more questions than making statements. ^rw103382664-note

- Use the right wording. Avoid leading questions and use a neutral tone instead. Refrain hinting at your opinion or the answer you’d like to get. If you want honest opinions or accurate information, don’t prime your interlocutor with loaded questions. Keep them open ended so they have the option of giving you an answer you didn’t expect.

    - Note: Ask lots of open ended questions. Don’t hunt at your own opinion, it influences what they will say. Always be open to answers you didn’t expect. ^rw103382665-note

- Build a hierarchy. Follow general questions with specific ones, focus your questions so they ask one thing at a time, and use something in the answer you got to frame your next question. This will help the conversation flow more naturally. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344720758/14370203)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/103382666) ^rw103382666
    - Note: Ask a question and base the next question on their answer. Ask for more detail on a certain part, ask how it relates to another topic, or ask how they learned it. Questions should go from general to specific ^rw103382666-note

- The most important guideline to remember is simply to ask more questions. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1344720758/14370208)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/103382667) ^rw103382667
    - Note: The biggest key is asking more questions. The more questions you ask the better you will get at asking them ^rw103382667-note
