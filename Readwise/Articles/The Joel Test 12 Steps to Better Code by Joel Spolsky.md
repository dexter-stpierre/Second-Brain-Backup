- Programmers are notoriously crabby about making schedules. “It will be done when it’s done!” they scream at the business people.
  Unfortunately, that just doesn’t cut it. There are too many planning decisions that the business needs to make well in advance of shipping the code: demos, trade shows, advertising, etc. And the only way to do this is to have a schedule, and to keep it up to date.

    - Note: Striving to keep on schedule can help prevent you from feeling like you have to keep every possible feature. Cut the least important features rather than pushing back the schedule ^rw294179586-note
