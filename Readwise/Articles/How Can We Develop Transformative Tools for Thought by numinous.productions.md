- A word on nomenclature: the term “tools for thought” rolls off neither the tongue nor the keyboard. What’s more, the term “tool” implies a certain narrowness. Alan Kay has argued Again, in Alan Kay, User Interface: A Personal View (1989), among other places. that a more powerful aim is to develop a new medium for thought. A medium such as, say, Adobe Illustrator is essentially different from any of the individual tools Illustrator contains. Such a medium creates a powerful immersive context, a context in which the user can have new kinds of thought, thoughts that were formerly impossible for them. Speaking loosely, the range of expressive thoughts possible in such a medium is an emergent property of the elementary objects and actions in that medium. If those are well chosen, the medium expands the possible range of human thought. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/94184786) ^rw94184786
    - Note: When tools are combined they create a new medium in which we can have thoughts that otherwise would have been impossible to have ^rw94184786-note

- With that said, the term “tools for thought” has been widely used since Iverson’s 1950s and 1960s work An account may be found in Iverson’s Turing Award lecture, Notation as a Tool of Thought (1979). Incidentally, even Iverson is really describing a medium for thought, the APL programming language, not a narrow tool. introducing the term. And so we shall use “tools for thought” as our catch all phrase, while giving ourselves license to explore a broader range, and also occasionally preferring the term “medium” when it is apt.

    - Note: The words “tool” and “medium” will be used for the same term. “Tool” will be a catch all while “medium” will refer to a space where you use multiple tools ^rw94184787-note

- What makes these subjects difficult? In fact, individually many of the underlying ideas are not too complicated for people with a technical background. But the ideas come in an overwhelming number, a tsunami of unfamiliar concepts and notation. People must learn in rapid succession of qubits, the bra-ket notation, Hadamard gates, controlled-not gates, and many, many other abstract, unfamiliar notions. They’re imbibing an entire new language. Even if they can follow at first, understanding later ideas requires fluency with all the earlier ideas. It’s overwhelming and eventually disheartening.

    - Note: The thing that makes learning certain topics hard isn’t necessarily the complexity of the material, especially at the beginning, it’s the good of information and terms, and the fact that if you don’t master the early ones then understanding the later ones is nearly impossible. Most people get frustrated and quit when learning such subjects. But if they found a way to manage the learning of the baseline material then they would not only be able to learn it better, but have tools to help themselves through the later material ^rw94184788-note

- This takes advantage of a fundamental fact about human memory: as we are repeatedly tested on a question, our memory of the answer gets stronger, and we are likely to retain it for longer The literature on this effect is vast. A useful entrée is: Gwern Branwen, Spaced Repetition for Efficient Learning.. This exponential rise perhaps seems innocuous, but it’s transformative. It means that a relatively small number of reviews will enable a user to remember for years. With the time taken to review a typical question being just a few seconds, that means a user can achieve long-term recall with no more than a few minutes’ work. By contrast, with conventional flashcards it takes hours of review to achieve the same durability. Exponential scheduling is far more efficient.

    - Note: I question if this truly helps you get a deep understanding of a topic or if it is simply memorizing something for memory’s sake. I’m not sure I see the benefit unless there is a specific reason I want to memorize something ^rw94184789-note

- So, for instance, after 6 repetitions, we see from the graph that most users are up around 6,000 days of demonstrated retention. That means an average of about 6,000 / 112 ~ 54 days per question in the essay. Intuitively, that seems pretty good – if you’re anything like us, a couple of months after reading something you have only a hazy memory. By contrast, these users have, at low time cost to themselves (of which more below), achieved nearly two months of demonstrated retention across 112 detailed questions.

    - Note: I fail to understand the benefit of this apart from school like memorization. Knowing the correct answer to a question does not give me working understanding of a topic ^rw94184790-note

- Despite these suggestive preliminary results, it’s still tempting to be dismissive. Isn’t this “just” an essay with flashcards embedded? At some level, of course, that’s correct. In the same way, wikis are just editable web pages; Twitter is just a way of sharing very short form writing; and Facebook is just a way of sharing writing and pictures with friends. Indeed, writing itself is just a clever way of ordering a small number of symbols on a page. While a medium may be simple, that doesn’t mean it’s not profound. As we shall see, the mnemonic medium has many surprising properties. It turns out that flashcards are dramatically under-appreciated, and it’s possible to go much, much further in developing the mnemonic medium than is a priori obvious.

    - Note: There is probably something I am missing but as of right now I am solidly in the “essay with flashcards” camp ^rw94184791-note
