- When I meet with any thing worth putting into my Common-Place-Book, I presently look for a proper Head. Suppose for Example, the Head were Epistola; I look in the Index the First Letter which the Vowel that follows, which in this Case E I. If there is found any Number in the Space marked E I, that shows me the space designed for Words which begin with E, and whose Vowel that immediately follows is I, I must refer to the word Epistola in the Page what I have to take notice of, I write the Head in pretty large Letters, so that the principal Word is found in the Margin, and I continue the Line in writing on what I have to remark. I constantly observe this Method, that nought but the Head appear in the Margin, and on and on without carrying the Line again into the Margin. When one has thus preserv’d the margin clear, the Heads, present themselves at First Sight.” [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/86668813) ^rw86668813
    - Note: This way of organizing knowledge seems too random to be reliable to me. Without a list of Heads which I apply to passages it is too dificult to know whether I am using multiple similar Heads that could be one, or if the information I am looking for is under a different, but similar Head. Thankfully I don’t think an index system such as this is useful to me as I keep the archive of my notes in a digital format and my handwritten notes are temporary and will get processed in regular intervals. However I do find the wat Locke handled notes to be interesting and I believe that I could pull some lessons from it to organize my own note taking ^rw86668813-note
