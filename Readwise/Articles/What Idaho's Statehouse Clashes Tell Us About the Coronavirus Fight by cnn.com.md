## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- As of Wednesday morning, none of the protesters faced charges for shoving the state troopers. Notably, ISP arrested dozens of protesters in 2014 for merely blocking doors at the statehouse. Those protesters tried unsuccessfully to convince the legislature to add protections for the LGBT+ community to the Idaho Human Rights Act.

- The protests this week weren't random or spontaneous. Many of the people who showed up on Monday morning were members of the "3 Percenters" or "Health Freedom Idaho." Ammon Bundy, of Malheur National Wildlife Refuge occupation fame, was also there. (Bundy was arrested on Tuesday afternoon and charged with trespassing for refusing to leave a hearing room at the state house.) Members of those groups, especially "Health Freedom Idaho," are regulars at legislative hearings concerning vaccinations, and have recently turned their attention to regional public health district meetings.

- In April, Bundy and members of these two groups protested at the private homes of Gov. Brad Little (R) and a police officer who arrested a mother for trespassing on a closed playground. In July, they shoved past public health district employees to enter a regional health district building, disregarding requests to wear masks and mocking those who did. Again, no one faced charges for the July protest. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85302945) ^rw85302945

- Davlin: In part. Gov. Little enraged members of his own party when he issued a stay-at-home order early in the pandemic. Idaho's lieutenant governor, Janice McGeachin, and then-chairman of the Idaho Republican Party Raul Labrador openly defied the order and appeared at a brewery's reopening event before restrictions eased. (That brewery has since faced fines.) Though Idaho was one of the first states to reopen, and has had almost no statewide restrictions for months, that rage has never let up, and prompted a recall effort that ultimately failed.

- Davlin: It's a little surreal to watch testimony from protesters who say they feel like they're living under martial law. There are nearly no restrictions statewide, and any restrictions that do exist come from individual cities, counties or public health districts. The state's current hottest spots are under no restrictions and have no mask mandates. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85302947) ^rw85302947

- The same is true for a number of Idaho's elected officials, both in the legislature and on city and county levels. Idaho is a largely rural state, but between schools reopening, outbreaks in food processing facilities, and a lack of virus mitigation efforts, the rural counties have consistently had some of the highest case rates throughout the pandemic. But the rejection of science from certain elected officials is playing into the public's distrust and anger. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85302948) ^rw85302948

- Cillizza: Finish this sentence: "The reaction to the Covid protocols tells us ________ about the current state of Idaho politics." Now, explain. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85302949) ^rw85302949

- Davlin: "Everything."
  It exposes infighting in the Idaho Republican Party, as well as long-running tension between the executive and legislative branches. It shows that people who are skeptical of science have an immense amount of power in state and local politics. It highlights inconsistencies in how the legislature and state treat protesters. And, sadly, it demonstrates how misinformation is steering much of the discussion. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85302950) ^rw85302950
