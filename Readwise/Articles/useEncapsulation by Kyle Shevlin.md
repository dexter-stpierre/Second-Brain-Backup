## Highlights

- ðŸ”¥ take I haven't fully thought through incoming: Every use of useEffect should be in a custom hook with a damn good name.
  It's frequently difficult to read & comprehend intention of the code when effects are strewn about. Better to encapsulate and provide context. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1395270108/17339190)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/221334664) ^rw221334664
    - Note: Putting a name to the hook brings a lot more clarity. And many useEffect hooks end up just setting some state variable. This could be done in the custom hook ^rw221334664-note
