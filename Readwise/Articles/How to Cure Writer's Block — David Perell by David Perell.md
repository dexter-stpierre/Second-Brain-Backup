## Highlights

- A fresh insight is a fragile thing, so Kendrick is a prolific note-taker. Ideas are perishable. His pen preserves what his memory forgets. When an idea isn’t saved, it starts to decay. But once his pen stops dancing across the page in front of him, he returns to the activity before him. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/96334470) ^rw96334470
    - Note: Ideas disappear as quickly as they appear. In order to have a reliable reservoir of ideas I need to record every idea I have ^rw96334470-note

- Small actions repeatedly done have transformative long-term benefits. Today, I live my life in pursuit of creative supplies. If I save three ideas per day, I’ll have 1,000 by the end of the year. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/96334471) ^rw96334471
    - Note: Having small and consistent habits make a huge difference in the long run. Just a few everyday will lead to thousands over the years ^rw96334471-note

- Like a river in high-spring, conversations always flow in surprising directions. Its casual, call-and-response nature is fuel for fresh ideas. Speaking with smart people is a guaranteed way to unlock creative inspiration, and when the conversation is over, I write new ideas down.

    - Note: Talking with other smart people gets ideas flowing. When you talk about ideas you think about ideas and your brain can creatively form new ideas and connections between ideas ^rw96334472-note

- Sometimes, I record my conversations. I use an app called Otter to transcribe them. For example, I record and transcribe every conversation with my friend Nik Sharma. Using only the raw material from those conversations, Nik and I write multiple articles per year. Crucially, we never sit down to write. We originate ideas by laughing about cultural trends and dreaming up bizarre ideas. Once our conversations are over, we read our transcripts, bold the best parts, and use those bolded sections as the foundation for our articles.

    - Note: I wonder if I can record FaceTime conversations with Sam and Alex to review later ^rw96334473-note

- Even as a writer, my goal is to write as little as possible. I want all my writing to happen away from the screen. The less I write, the better my ideas. Books, conversations, and surprising experiences are the genesis of most great ideas. I want perfect alignment between the activities required to write at a high-level and those required to live a meaningful life. The more time I can spend with friends and family, the better.

    - Note: Do what inspires you to do your craft more than you actually do your craft and you will never be short on inspiration. You will always have ideas you can draw from and will never start with a blank page ^rw96334474-note
