- “The Process:
  1) Decide what you want to achieve.2) Try different ways of achieving it until you find one that works for you.3) Do more of what works. Do less of what doesn’t.
  4) Don’t stop doing it until it stops working.
  5) Repeat.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1402133101/16049041)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/165708243) ^rw165708243
    - Note: I tend to get stuck on one way of doing things and trying to force it to work out expecting it to work forever. I need to start trying different ways ^rw165708243-note

- “If you never fail, you’re only trying things that are too easy and playing far below your level… If you can’t remember any time in the last six months when you failed, you aren’t trying to do difficult enough things.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1402133101/16049083)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/165708244) ^rw165708244
    - Note: Failure is a clear sign that you are really pushing yourself ^rw165708244-note

- Deep listening is an act of surrender. We risk being changed by what we hear.
  When I really want to hear another person’s story, I try to leave my preconceptions at the door and draw close to their telling. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1402133101/16049119)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/165708245) ^rw165708245
    - Note: Listening without preconceptions is the only way to truly understand someone else’s experience. Remember that all of their knowledge, experience, and beliefs inform the things that they are saying, it isn’t just empty words to them. Try to understand the critical knowledge and beliefs that inform what they are sharing ^rw165708245-note

- The most critical part of listening is asking what is at stake for the other person. I try to understand what matters to them, not what I think matters. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1402133101/16049139)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/165708246) ^rw165708246
    - Note: Listening to someone’s story involves letting yourself experience it from their point of view. When doing this it is easier to ask more about their experience to fill in the gap rather than just replying with your own similar experience. ^rw165708246-note

- Sometimes I start to lose myself in their story. As soon as I notice feeling unmoored, I try to pull myself back into my body, like returning home. As Hannah Arendt says, ‘One trains one’s imagination to go visiting.’ When the story is done, we must return to our skin, our own worldview, and notice how we have been changed by our visit.

    - Note: When listening to someone else’s story you can’t just indiscriminately accept their story as the truth of the world and morph your beliefs accordingly. You also can’t just ignore it or consider it in a vacuum. Once you have listened to it consider how it relates to your own worldview, and how other stories you have heard before relate to, inform, or discredit the story. Getting new information should impact your worldview, whether it solidifies it or morphs it ^rw165708247-note
