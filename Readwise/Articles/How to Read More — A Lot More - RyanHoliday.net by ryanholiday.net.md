## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- Carry a book with you at all times. Every time you get a second, crack it open. Don’t install games on your phone–that’s time you could be reading. When you’re eating, read. When you’re on the train, in the waiting room, at the office–read. It’s work, really important work. Don’t let anyone ever let you feel like it’s not.

    - Note: When reading is what you do whenever you have a spare moment you will read far more than you do now ^rw98773726-note

- Perhaps the reason you having trouble is you forgot the purpose of reading. It’s not just for fun. Human beings have been recording their knowledge in book form for more than 5,000 years. That means that whatever you’re working on right now, whatever problem you’re struggling with, is probably addressed in some book somewhere by someone a lot smarter than you. Save yourself the trouble of learning from trial and error–find that point. Benefit from that perspective. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/98773727) ^rw98773727
    - Note: Most problems you encounter in life has probably been addressed by the thousands of years worth of books that have been written. Reading lots of books means finding lots of answers and not learning from you mistakes. Learn from others mistakes and others victories ^rw98773727-note
