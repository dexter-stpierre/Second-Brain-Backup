## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- After creating a new permanent note to add to your slip-box, identify related permanent notes already in your slip-box and comment on how they fit together or contradict each other. You’re connecting old knowledge with new knowledge, old ideas with new ideas. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/96542971) ^rw96542971
    - Note: It is important to link notes to each other and explicitly detail how they agree or contridict each other. In Roam I can do this both using links in the note itself or indented in blocks underneath, which makes the most sense for that scenario. ^rw96542971-note

- Tying your new permanent notes to existing ones will help you connect new knowledge with existing knowledge. You’re creating a network of ideas, wherein one idea can trigger other ideas it’s connected to. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/96542972) ^rw96542972
    - Note: The goal isn’t just to have a bunch of notes. it is to have an interconnected network of ideas that build on top of and related to each other ^rw96542972-note

- Add #[[permanent notes]] as a keyword to your new note. This will create a bi-directional link from your new note to the permanent notes page (your slip-box). You can think of adding the #[[permanent notes]] keyword as adding the note to your slip-box. Alternatively, as shown in the screenshot above, you can add the #[[permanent notes]] link as a part of the template. That way, when you copy it to use on a new permanent note, it will already be included. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/96542973) ^rw96542973
    - Note: I like this idea of having an actual slip-box in Roam. I guess I had always though of permanent notes as just being another block or page without clear connections ^rw96542973-note
