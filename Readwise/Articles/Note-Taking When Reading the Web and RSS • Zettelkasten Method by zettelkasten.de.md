## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- Filter interesting information to clear your streams. To filter means to collect the useful pieces only. But don’t stop just there, or your growing collection will hinder you. Instead, create a reading list you’re going to review and work off routinely.

    - Note: Don’t let the list of collected texts get out of hand. Have strict criteria of what to save and stricter criteria of what to read. Don’t be afraid to delete something if no longer interested, if it is truly great it will probably come up again ^rw100098034-note
