## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- It's important for me that everything I design is both accessible, ethical and user friendly. And to be fair, the three really go hand-in-hand. A product cannot be friendly if it's harmful or inaccessible. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85534708) ^rw85534708

- Color blind for Figma is one of the best tools to test how designs look for people with different types of colorblindness. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85534709) ^rw85534709

- Able is a great option for checking the contrast of text. Select two layers and the plugin will tell you what the values are and whether it passes WCAG accessibility guidelines or not. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85534710) ^rw85534710

- I often use color palette generators in combination with Figma's accessibility plugins when deciding on color schemes. They're good for inspiration and push me to explore combinations I usually wouldn't think of.
  Colorable is really useful one for that. It randomizes predefined color combinations and includes pass/fail scores for the WCAG accessibility guidelines. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85534711) ^rw85534711

- Another good color generator is Khroma. It generates an infinite amount of color combinations based on colors you like, and also includes values with regards to the WCAG. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85534712) ^rw85534712
