## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- “We should hunt out the helpful pieces of teaching and the spirited and noble-minded sayings which are capable of immediate practical application–not far far-fetched or archaic expressions or extravagant metaphors and figures of speech–and learn them so well that words become works.” [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/93365318) ^rw93365318
    - Note: Our goal should be to seek out practical knowledge from wise teachers and as we learn transform the lessons to actions that impact our lives or other peoples lives ^rw93365318-note

- Read widely. Read about anything and everything and be open to seeing what you didn’t expect to be there–that’s how you find the best stuff. Shelby Foote, “I can’t begin to tell you the things I discovered while I was looking for something else.” [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/93365342) ^rw93365342
    - Note: Sometimes you find the best information when you are looking for something entirely different. Make sure you read a wide assortment of different kinds of literature, what I might find in a different kind might surprise you ^rw93365342-note

- Wisdom, not facts. We’re not just looking random pieces of information. What’s the point of that? Your commonplace book, over a lifetime (or even just several years), can accumulate a mass of true wisdom–that you can turn to in times of crisis, opportunity, depression or job. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/93365343) ^rw93365343
    - Note: I’m not just trying to make a book filled with various facts. I am looking for a book filled with wisdom and understanding. Facts are only helpful insofar as they lead to wisdom or understanding ^rw93365343-note

- After you finish the book, put it down for a week or so. Let it percolate in your head. Now, return to it and review all the material you’ve saved and transfer the marginalia and passages to your commonplace book. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/93365344) ^rw93365344
    - Note: Give yourself time to let the book simmer in your mind. But don’t wait to long. Make sure to review notes a week or two after completing a book. Don’t let books pile up waiting to be reviewed ^rw93365344-note
