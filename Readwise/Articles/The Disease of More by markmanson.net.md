- “What if there is no ‘next level?’ What if it’s just an idea you made up in your head? What if you’re already there and not only are you not recognizing it, but by constantly pursuing something more, you’re preventing yourself from appreciating it and enjoying where you are now?” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1419083907/16647028)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/189824717) ^rw189824717

- it means that we need to be motivated in life by something more than our own happiness. It means that we have to be driven by something greater than ourselves. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1419083907/16647119)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/189824718) ^rw189824718

- But I eventually learned that the funny thing about self-improvement for the sake of self-improvement is that it doesn’t inherently mean anything. It’s just a glorified hobby. It’s something to keep you occupied and to enthusiastically discuss with other people who have the same hobby.

    - Note: Most self improvement people would hate to hear this, but it is true. What are you trying to improve for? What is the end goal? Will achieving it really make your life better? ^rw189824719-note

- When one compulsively looks to improve oneself, without any greater cause or reason driving it other than self-aggrandizement, it leads to a life of immense self-preoccupation, a light and beneficent form of narcissism where one’s constant attention and focus is on oneself.

    - Note: Constant focus on self improvement keeps the focus constantly on yourself. Make sure to engage in hobbies that bring the focus onto others and engage with those around you in selfless ways ^rw189824720-note

- I think the same principle is true with all forms of self-improvement. Self-improvement tools should be used like bandages, only to be opened and applied when something is hurt or seriously wrong, and with the goal always being to eventually remove them.
