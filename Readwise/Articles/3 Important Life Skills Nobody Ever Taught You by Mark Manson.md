## Highlights

- we tend to have an [inherent bias](https://markmanson.net/cognitive-biases-that-make-us-terrible) towards assuming that pretty much everything that happens to us *is actually about us*.
  But here’s a newsflash: Just because you experience something, just because something causes you to feel a certain way, just because you care about something, doesn’t mean it’s about you.

- It feels good to think that everything that’s good that happens in your life happens to you because you’re this good, amazing person. But the price you pay for making those good experiences about you is that you must also make the bad experiences about you—you must interpret all of the bad things in your life to be about you as well.

    - Note: I feel like Christians have a tendency to make the good all about themselves and God, but the bad isn’t. When something good happens it’s because they prayed, or were obedient, or some other reason. But when something bad happens it’s an attack, or the devil, or a test. ^rw274100527-note

- When people criticize you or reject you, it likely has way more to do with them—their [values](https://markmanson.net/personal-values), their priorities, their life situation—than it does with you. I hate to break it to you, but other people simply don’t think about you that much (after all, they’re too busy trying to believe everything is *about them*).

    - Note: I think this is where a lot of division comes from. People with massively different values. And the way that they pursue those is massively different. But we as humans tend to take that personally. But just because different people have different values doesn’t mean that everyone’s values are right. Or correctly prioritized. But that’s not work I can do for them ^rw274100674-note

- pain has no prejudice—it afflicts us all. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fsya6y58mba26jhx0j222025)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/274101343) ^rw274101343

- You’re going to be wrong a lot in life. In fact, you’re going to be [wrong pretty much all of the time](https://markmanson.net/wrong-about-everything). And in many ways, your ability to succeed and learn over the long term is directly proportional to your ability to change what you believe in response to your ignorance and mistakes.
