## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- The aim of these books wasn’t regurgitation but rather combinatorial creativity. People were encouraged to improvise on themes and topics. Gathering raw material alone — in this case, information — is not enough. We must transform it into something new. It is in this light that Seneca advised copying the bee and Einstein advised combinatorial play.

    - Note: The point of taking notes is to create new and creative connections between the things we are learning, not to simply record information ^rw102457309-note

- In all sorts of learning, and especially in the study of languages, the memory is the treasury or store-house, … but lest the memory should be oppressed or over-burthen’d by too many things, order and method are to be called into its assistance. So that when we extract any thing out of an author, which is like to be of future use, we may be able to find it without any trouble. For it would be of little purpose to spend our time in [the] reading of books, if we could not apply what we read to our use.

    - Note: The point of reading is to learn and apply the things we learn to our lives. Anything that helps accomplish this goal is additive, anything that blocks it is subtractive. Taking notes so we can find the things we learned when we need them in the future is very helpful ^rw102457310-note

- The places we design to extract from are to be marked upon a piece of paper, that we may do it after we have read the book out; neither is it to be done just after the first reading of the book, but when we have read it a second time.

    - Note: Reading the book twice before extracting information from in helps make sure that we are pulling the very best. 
      I’m not sure that this is an approach I want to take ^rw102729624-note
