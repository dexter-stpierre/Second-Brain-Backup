## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- The most successful people (judged by history, not money) continually look for the most important thing they are able to work on, and that’s what they do. They do not get trapped in local maxima, and they do not deceive themselves if they find something more important. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/94184605) ^rw94184605
    - Note: Focus not on what my job is or what others tell me is important, focus on what I believe is the most important thing ^rw94184605-note

- Getting caught up in the parts of a job that don’t matter is a dangerous trap and for some reason one that a lot of people fall into. Let other people play political games and avoid them as much as you can. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/94184606) ^rw94184606
    - Note: Be really good at the parts of my job that actually matter. Don’t mess with the rest

- The most value comes from doing something no one else can do, or no one else has thought of, in a way that is hard for other people to copy. If you try to be just like everyone else, and do just what they’re doing, you will maybe do ok but certainly not great. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/94184607) ^rw94184607
    - Note: How can I bring unique value to my job right now? ^rw94184607-note

- Follow your own curiosity, and start looking internally instead of externally for the answers. Be honest with yourself about the intersection of your skills, your passions, and what the world values. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/94184608) ^rw94184608
    - Note: I often have the answers I am looking for already. I have to search within myself before I go looking for answers elsewhere. Other people’s answers might help me along but my own answers will energize and drive me ^rw94184608-note
