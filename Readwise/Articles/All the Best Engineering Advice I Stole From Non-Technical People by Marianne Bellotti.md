- It’s intriguing that the stuff that really seems to make a difference in the quality of software never seems to be about software. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fs576j9pye32y0361mwj9dnp)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/269817654) ^rw269817654

### “People like us make our money in the seams of things”
- I became comfortable with being wrong 95% of the time because I understood that when I found that one critical problem all the ideas I had before that had been ruled out would be forgotten. I found a few problems much more experienced engineers had missed and it gave me super powers in the eyes of my colleagues.

- Being a person who is not afraid to ask the stupid questions and who lets ideas get thrown out easily without a big argument has created an environment where correcting each other and debate doesn’t feel like that big a deal. It normalizes the process and people stop keeping score because it’s clear that their boss isn’t.

- When you’re discussing a problem or situation there are basically three buckets of information: things that are true, things that are false, and things that are true but irrelevant.

- Having a culture where people are not optimizing to avoid mentioning something true but irrelevant means we make better technical decisions overall because we get the benefit of every teammate’s complete perspective.

### “Know what people are asking you to be an expert in”
- “You didn’t trick anyone, we know who we hired” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fs5swgw2gn2bn3nkv8bk4cwb)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/269894225) ^rw269894225

- When I find myself itching to interrupt someone with my thoughts about a topic I try to ask myself “what am I being asked to be an expert in here?” Often I realize that in my enthusiasm to show my casual knowledge I’m about to correct someone that who has devoted a considerable amount of time and effort into developing their expertise in the topic.

### “Before you can make things better, you have to stop making them worse”
### “To go left, turn right”
### “Thinking is also work”
- replacing trust with process is called bureaucracy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fs617s5qcvrxp6bv5nmzn0c1)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/269918597) ^rw269918597

- trust also degrades naturally over time. Italian researchers Cristiano Castelfranchi and Rino Falcone have a model of trust in which it’s ***observability*** not success that is the key factor. Under their theory an entity that is silently successful can end up seen as less trustworthy than an entity that visibly fails. If we recover from failure quickly and efficiently, trust increases. Whereas when we succeed and no one notices we become more and more unknown and uncertain. This explains what is known as the *service recovery paradox*, when consumers trust a service provider more after a failure than they did before the failure.
