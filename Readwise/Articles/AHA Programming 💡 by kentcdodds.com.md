## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- prefer duplication over the wrong abstraction ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fmw58t38gn045hysn0j95q0s)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/250764521) ^rw250764521
    - Note: If you have duplication and something needs to change for one of the duplicates you can safely do that without worries. If you have a bad abstraction and something needs to change for one implementation you need to think about all the side effects ^rw250764521-note

- So I'm fine with code duplication until you feel pretty confident that you know the use cases for that duplicate code. What parts of the code are different that would make good arguments to your function? After you've got a few places where that code is running, the commonalities will scream at you for abstraction and you'll be in the right frame of mind to provide that abstraction.

    - Note: When you write an abstraction you should have used the code in so many places that the abstraction is crystal clear. If you are still hazy or trying to figure out how to future proof it then you probably havenâ€™t written it out in enough different places ^rw250769262-note

- I used a tool called [jsinspect](https://github.com/danielstjules/jsinspect) to identify chunks of copy/pasted code ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fmw74kkqcd9fekcjzhsmzzq5)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/250769435) ^rw250769435
    - Note: This could be a really useful tool ^rw250769435-note
