- "More effort is wasted doing things that don’t matter than is wasted doing things inefficiently.
  Elimination is the highest form of optimization." ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409905830/16321849)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/176914313) ^rw176914313
    - Note: Sometimes you don't have to focus on doing things better, you simply have to remove the unnecessary. ^rw176914313-note

- "We cannot predict the value our work will provide to the world. That’s fine. It is not our job to judge our own work. It is our job to create it, to pour ourselves into it, and to master our craft as best we can."

- "You can increase your surface area for good luck by taking action.
  The forager who explores widely will find lots of useless terrain, but is also more likely to stumble across a bountiful berry patch than the person who stays home.
  Similarly, the person who works hard, pursues opportunity, and tries more things is more likely to stumble across a lucky break than the person who waits." ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409905830/16321859)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/176914315) ^rw176914315
    - Note: Sometimes you just have to start taking steps to find the thing that works out. If you fail 9 times but succeed the 10th it's worth it. It is better than never trying the first time. ^rw176914315-note
