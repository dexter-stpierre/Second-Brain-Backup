## Highlights
### New highlights synced

- When I have granular, objective data on “what happened this week” (e.g. RescueTime, calendar, todo lists) I’ve found it helpful to review that because it occasionally surprises me. (See the points about RescueTime above.) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/85302940) ^rw85302940
