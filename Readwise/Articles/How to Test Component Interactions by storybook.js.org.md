- Stories are written in a portable format based on standard JavaScript modules. You can reuse them with any JavaScript-based testing library (Jest, Testing Lib, Playwright). That saves you from needing to set up and maintain test cases for each testing tool in your suite.

- Writing test cases as stories means that you only need to do the tricky setup once: isolate components, mock their dependencies and capture their use cases. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1435945269/17267758)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/217738156) ^rw217738156

- What’s more, the portability of stories also simplifies accessibility testing. When you ensure your UI is usable to every user, you impact the business financials and satisfy legal requirements. It’s a win-win. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1435945269/17267764)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/217738157) ^rw217738157
