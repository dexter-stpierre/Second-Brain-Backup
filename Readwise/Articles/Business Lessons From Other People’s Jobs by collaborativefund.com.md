- “Consistent with my belief that it is more productive to read around one’s field than in one’s field, there are no investing books on this list,” it read. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1440586190/17335945)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/221162776) ^rw221162776
    - Note: The idea of reading around your field instead of in it is interesting. I personally don’t read a ton about development but I do feel that the things I read do help with development ^rw221162776-note

- Poet: Quality does not scale with the number of inputs. You can make a more powerful point in 10 words than you can 10,000. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1440586190/17335953)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/221162777) ^rw221162777

- Accountant: You can lie more easily with numbers than you can with words. People associate numbers with math, and math with facts, leading them to be more gullible with numbers than they are when confronted with words alone.
