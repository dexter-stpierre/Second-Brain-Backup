- I think that written communication skills are still a massively underrated skill set in Engineering. Here are the questions I think you should ask yourself as you're writing technical content (docs, blogs, emails, slides, etc...): 1) Are the code samples syntactically correct and do they follow best practices for their language? 2) Is the code for any sample apps included in a GitHub repo with a README. md? 3) Are the prerequisites and necessary version numbers included? 4) Are the concepts presented accurately and are they easy to understand? 5) Are the relevant links included and do they work as expected? 6) Does your tutorial steps work from top to bottom? 7) Did you run your code locally and did you run into any issues? 8) Have you defined all jargon? Now it's your turn! What do you think people should keep in mind when writing something for a technical audience? Let me know in the comments!
