## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- If you have the right tools and approach, there is no topic that you cannot grok. Some things will take longer to understand, but everything will succumb under the pressure of attention at some point. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181153/16352691)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/177922747) ^rw177922747
    - Note: By setting up successful processes and following through on them you can learn anything you set your mind to. ^rw177922747-note

- By taking notes, I never waste time and effort. Something may only be relevant now because of my interest, but it has often happened that a personal interest came in handy in a professional setting months later. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181153/16352701)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/177922748) ^rw177922748
    - Note: You never know when your notes will be useful and in what contexts. Well conected notes will be a huge asset in every area of your life. ^rw177922748-note
    - Date:: [[May 11th, 2021, Tuesday]]
- Hopefully, at the end of this series, you will have a good grasp of a proven note-taking system. I also hope you will understand my system well enough to make adaptations that work for your specific situation. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181153/16352711)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/177922749) ^rw177922749
    - Note: Learning other people’s methods only helps so far as it inspires you to create your own. ^rw177922749-note
    - Date:: [[May 11th, 2021, Tuesday]]
- Hopefully, this article will bring you the inspiration to do your work better. If that’s the case, my other hope is that you share your insights with other learners and knowledge workers on the web. Together, we can become better. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181153/16352740)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/177922750) ^rw177922750
    - Note: The point of learning is not just to improve your own life and grow your own knowledge but also to teach others and grow our collective human understanding. ^rw177922750-note

- The inputs below are my favorites. I deliberately limit the formats I learn from, as it makes mastery of each more likely. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181153/16360334)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178140275) ^rw178140275
    - Note: Limiting the types of input you expose yourself to gives you the time and focus to become very good at them. Rather than having a bunch of different types of input that you are constantly having to learn how to take input from you are only having a few that you really master ^rw178140275-note

- My number one source of knowledge are books. They pack so much value compared to their investment; it’s insane. But remember: many books should be articles (and many articles should be tweets, but that’s another story for another day). Cut out the fluff. Read classic books that not everyone is reading and distill the nuggets of wisdom. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181153/16360358)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178140276) ^rw178140276
    - Note: Books have an incredible ROI, but only if you read books with high quality content. The best chances you have of finding high quality content is the classic books that people aren’t reading as much. While reading the goal is to condense the wisdom into bite sized pieces that will be useful in other areas of your life ^rw178140276-note
    - Date:: [[May 12th, 2021, Wednesday]]
- Books condense hundreds of hours of research into a package you can digest in 10-20 hours (including taking notes). ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181153/16360362)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178140277) ^rw178140277
    - Date:: [[May 12th, 2021, Wednesday]]
- People create summaries of books that you can check out to see if the book is worth reading in its entirety. Reading summaries also primes you for the ideas in the book. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181153/16360368)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178140278) ^rw178140278
    - Note: I generally consider summaries to be distracting to have in mind when I read a book ^rw178140278-note
    - Date:: [[May 12th, 2021, Wednesday]]
- Most pieces are not worth reading. But with the right techniques, you know how to recognize the worthy ones and distill ideas from them quickly. Articles are great to dip your toes in a topic. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181153/16360377)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178140279) ^rw178140279
    - Note: Articles are a great way to get a general idea of a topic or a deep dive into a very specific topic, but not great for a deep dive into a topic at large ^rw178140279-note
    - Date:: [[May 12th, 2021, Wednesday]]
- Like books, courses tend to present a lot of research in condensed form. Each lesson usually has one overreaching theme. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181153/16360392)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178140280) ^rw178140280
    - Date:: [[May 12th, 2021, Wednesday]]
- Courses provide access to an expert (the teacher) who you can ask for clarification. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181153/16360403)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178140281) ^rw178140281
    - Note: Having direct access to an expert is so valuable when trying to deep dive on a topic. Having lots of well thought out questions is valuable here ^rw178140281-note
    - Date:: [[May 12th, 2021, Wednesday]]
- Your diffuse attention keeps working on problems in the background; when an idea bubbles up, you’ll want to write it down right away. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181153/16360412)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178140282) ^rw178140282
    - Note: Having a way to capture random thoughts is a critical part of the process ^rw178140282-note
    - Date:: [[May 12th, 2021, Wednesday]]
- Hypothesis ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181153/16360435)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178140283) ^rw178140283
    - Note: I should start using this as a secondary highlighter. If I am just skimming an article, reading something on Facebook, or something else entirely being able to take a quick note would be so helpful. And it all ends up in the same place (Roam) ^rw178140283-note

- How often has it happened that you quickly want to note something down, only to forget it because your note-taking app takes forever to load? This happened to me all the !@#$%^& time, until I started to use Drafts. I mainly use it because it’s blazing fast and always loads with a fresh note, but there are loads of neat tricks you can do with it to automate your workflow. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181153/16360457)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178140284) ^rw178140284
    - Note: I use Apple notes because it comes preloaded on my devices and is wicked fast. But I do miss out on automation. But having 2 inboxes to look at isn’t the end of the world. I would need a solution if it was more than that or if I needed to use a non apple device ^rw178140284-note

- Academics and those working with PDFs may know Zotero and the Zotfile plugin by now. This free software makes it extremely easy to organize and sync PDFs. It has no PDF reader, but it makes up for it by handling edits made with any PDF reader. I use it in combination with PaperShip on the iPad, which directly syncs with my free Zotero account that contains all my PDFs, highlights, and annotations ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181153/16360465)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178140285) ^rw178140285
    - Note: I wonder if this app syncs with Readwise ^rw178140285-note

- All this talk about tools is nice and all, but we undertake this journey for a reason: to get to understanding.
  Understanding of what? Of how the world and its parts work. The problems we face are becoming more complicated by the day, and having clarity of thought is of utmost importance. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181153/16360480)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178140286) ^rw178140286
    - Note: Having a note taking system is all for nothing if you don’t have a goal of some kind of output ^rw178140286-note
    - Date:: [[May 12th, 2021, Wednesday]]
- Tweeting about what you learn forces you to revisit your notes. By re-reading your notes, you will have one extra editing pass. Don’t let a lack of full understanding keep you from sharing; the Twittersphere will correct you soon enough. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181153/16360506)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178140287) ^rw178140287
    - Note: Tweeting about something forces you to review the notes that you took and think on them again, doing an additional edit. You don’t have to be an expert, just write out some thoughts and put it out there ^rw178140287-note
    - Date:: [[May 12th, 2021, Wednesday]]
- You don’t need to start a blog to start writing articles. If you have solved a problem, write about it to find gaps you hadn’t considered yet. Often, these articles will sit in your note-taking system for your own use. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181153/16360526)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178140288) ^rw178140288
    - Note: Writing articles for yourself is legitimate output ^rw178140288-note
    - Date:: [[May 12th, 2021, Wednesday]]
- Once you have fleshed out the solution to a problem and notice more people face the same issues, you should consider writing a guide. Especially for the IT folks out there, guides are a perfect way to clarify your workflow for yourself and help others along the way. There’s no need to keep reinventing the wheel, share your knowledge. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181153/16360549)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178140289) ^rw178140289
    - Note: If you solve a difficult problem write up a little guide on it, especially if you couldn’t find one to help you. Even if there is another out there already your perspective is valuable and still worth sharing, just make sure to share your sources too! ^rw178140289-note

- Creating a course is a lot of work, and teaching well is difficult. First, educate people through tweets, newsletters, and articles before you take on anything more significant. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181153/16360562)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178140290) ^rw178140290
    - Note: Creating courses is valuable but you should have practice teaching people on a topic through other forms first ^rw178140290-note
    - Date:: [[May 12th, 2021, Wednesday]]
- how do you look at your own tech stack? Have you chosen your inputs and tools carefully? Do they enable you to get out of your learning what you want? ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411181153/16360569)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178140291) ^rw178140291
