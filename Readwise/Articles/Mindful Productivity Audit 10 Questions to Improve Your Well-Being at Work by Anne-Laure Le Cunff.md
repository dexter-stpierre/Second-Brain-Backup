## Highlights

- Performing a mindful productivity audit is a way to assess your current systems so you can perform better in your work while taking care of your mind. It’s purposely short so you can regularly ask yourself these questions and notice the impact of any changes you made after your last audit.

    - Note: Depending on how I feel about this it could be a good candidate for my monthly reviews ^rw264544497-note

- While there is a lot of variance in research studies, it seems that we need to take short breaks (5 to 10 minutes) every hour or so, and longer breaks (at least 30 minutes) every two to four hours.

    - Note: I think I want my work day breaks to mostly comprise of off screen activities. It is easy to take a “break” to just read a blog post and spend my entire day staring at a screen. Offline breaks are important ^rw264632940-note

- Make a list of all of the ways you currently cultivate your curiosity, and ask yourself: are there enough opportunities to experiment, learn, and grow? Too many or too scattered? How aligned are these learning opportunities with my goals? Are there learning opportunities I’m putting off for fear of failure? Do I have enough space for playful, undirected exploration?

    - Note: Listing the ways in which I fuel my curiosity would be really interesting. I can evaluate the list and decide where I need to add or remove things ^rw264633170-note
