- 1700 words later, this is the part that most “productivity” articles focus on. But, the more I’ve refined the process, the less and less important I think most of this is. If you have well organized goals you care about, you’ll get them done. You won’t need to do silly things like the pomodoro technique, you’ll just do the work. But there are a few habits I’ve developed that I think are really helpful. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/93989108) ^rw93989108
    - Note: The biggest key to productivity isn’t using fancy tools or techniques, it is setting and tracking goals I really, truly care about ^rw93989108-note

- I’ll wake up and read and have my coffee / tea and usually start work around 8, which gives me four hours of completely uninterrupted focus to get my most important work done. I also (almost) never schedule a meeting before noon, so I can be sure that I’ll get at least a few hours of Deep Work in each morning.

    - Note: Getting time to do deep, focused work uninterrupted is critical to getting my priorities complete. The morning is usually a great time to do this ^rw93989109-note

- Procrastination is fine, you just want to keep it small and quick, and you want to keep the idea in your head that you can quickly conquer procrastination if you ask yourself “what am I not sure how to make progress on.” Then go figure out a clearer next step and get back to it.

    - Note: According to Nat procrastination is what you do when you aren’t totally sure what to do next. So when I find myself going to me little procrastinations I should evaluate what I need to work on and make a clearer next action ^rw93989110-note

- At the end of the week, ideally Friday evening but sometimes Sunday, I’ll do a weekly review. This has the same goal as the daily review: reflect, clear the slate, set new goals. I’ll see how the week’s goals and habits went, clear out and capture everything from the week, and set new goals for next week. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/93989111) ^rw93989111
    - Note: I really wanna get in the habit of a weekly review. I think I can benefit a lot from this practice ^rw93989111-note
