- Assuming he’s below average encourages him to ask questions and listen more. Here’s how he justifies the mindset shift: "To assume you’re below average is to admit you’re still learning. You focus on what you need to improve, not your past accomplishments.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1353954536/14376258)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/103572825) ^rw103572825
    - Note: Assuming you are below average isn’t to say that you are bad, it is simply admitting that you have a lot to learn, and stating that you are doing that on a consistent basis to improve. Instead of trying to think of yourself as the best at a thing strive to be the one who learns, practices, and improves the most ^rw103572825-note

- Assume you’re a rampant copycat with no capacity for independent thought. You’re a robot who mirrors your inputs. You produce what you consume, and no matter how hard you try, you won’t be able to generate new ideas.

    - Note: If you treat your input as a direct indicator of your output you will filter your input more and take them way more seriously. High quality input = high quality output. If you only read what everyone else reads you can only produce what everyone else produces ^rw103572826-note

- Autistics, for example, are natural cosmopolitans who are less likely to think in narratives or be fooled by endowment effects. They have gifts for pattern recognition, information collecting, and noticing small details, so they classify the world in unusual ways. They’re especially good at seeing details other people miss.
