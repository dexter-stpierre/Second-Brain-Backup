## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- He talks about the different kinds of notes you can take, with the idea being that you slowly build upwards towards more and more structure, as you think about any given topic. (I highly recommend looking at what he has to say on this topic himself, in his online notebook, which he recently made publicly visible in an act of wonderful generosity — see below — and thanks, Andy!).

- “Level one” evergreen note - aka [[🌲1]] [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/75451743) ^rw75451743

- This is where you are free-writing and you suddenly realize that something *might* come in handy later as a conceptual placeholder, so you go ahead and make it into a topic, without really even knowing what will connect with that topic.

- This is the level of neatly defined concepts, or as Andy writes, “terms of art” — that is, the concept-knowledge building blocks that you need in order to start thinking about a complex topic. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/75451746) ^rw75451746

- “Level 3” evergreen note (aka [[🌲3]]) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/75451747) ^rw75451747

- What Andy suggests is that at this level, the notes have titles that are, essentially, short, declarative statements, that can be supported by what you have written or cited elsewhere. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/75451748) ^rw75451748

- writing a good “Level 3” note — that such notes should be “precise” and “narrow”; (in that sense, they function much like the process of questioning by a skilled lawyer in a legal case, where the goal is to be really careful and incremental, carefully making only such claims as you can back up with your work elsewhere.)

- “Level 4” Evergreen Note [[🌲4]] [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/75451750) ^rw75451750

- A level 4 note is built on top of one or more level 3 notes. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/75451751) ^rw75451751

- When Evergreen notes are factored and titled well, those titles become an abstraction for the note itself. The entire note’s ideas can then be referenced using that handle.
  In fact, this property itself functions as a kind of litmus: as you develop ideas in notes over time, and improve the “APIs,” you’ll be able to write individual notes which abstract over increasingly large subtrees (e.g. “Enacted experiences have incredible potential as a mass medium”, “Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work”).
  Some effective note “API design” techniques:
  separation of concerns (Evergreen notes should be atomic),
  sharp titles (Prefer declarative and imperative note titles to sharpen claims), and
  positive framings (Prefer positive note titles to promote systematic theory). [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/75451752) ^rw75451752
