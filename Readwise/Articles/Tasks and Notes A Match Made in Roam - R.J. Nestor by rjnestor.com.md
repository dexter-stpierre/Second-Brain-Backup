## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- A category is a page where your tasks will either live or be “pulled” to by queries. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1347663296/16207484)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/172167375) ^rw172167375
    - Date:: [[April 26th, 2021, Monday]]
- A context is a page used as a tag. Contexts provide extra information about a task. They can tell you where, how, or when a task should be done, or define its priority or how long it will take.

    - Date:: [[April 26th, 2021, Monday]]
- To make contexts easier to recognize at a glance, and to leverage Roam’s autocomplete, I use “@” as a prefix for all my contexts. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1347663296/16207496)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/172167377) ^rw172167377
    - Date:: [[April 26th, 2021, Monday]]
- The recurring task system defines the pages that help you process your routines. It takes about 15 minutes a week to maintain recurring tasks. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1347663296/16207501)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/172167378) ^rw172167378

- once a day, I review my [[Inbox]] page and process the potential tasks further. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1347663296/16207508)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/172167379) ^rw172167379

- I organize my [[Projects]] page based on my priorities: Family, Development (personal & professional), Coaching, Creative, Music Work, and so forth. This provides me a nice heuristic: if an incoming project doesn’t fit into one of my priority areas, is it a project I should even be doing?

    - Note: Orgagnizing projects according to your priorities not only ensures that you understand how a project impacts your life, it also helps ensure that you only commit to projects that align with your priorities ^rw172167380-note

- My individual projects are pages listed under my priorities. Each project page has sections for Tasks, Questions, and Notes, which allows me to keep all my information relevant to a project in the same place.

- The key to maintaining the link between your notes and your tasks is using Roam Research’s block references. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1347663296/16207562)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/172167382) ^rw172167382
    - Date:: [[April 26th, 2021, Monday]]
- Each evening, I build my [[Agenda]] for the following day. I do this directly on my Daily Notes page ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1347663296/16207664)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/172174540) ^rw172174540
    - Date:: [[April 26th, 2021, Monday]]
- To start, I type [[Agenda]] and indent underneath it. Then I review my calendar and add the times of specific meetings.
  Next, I open [[Next Actions]] in my right sidebar and go through them. When I encounter one I’d like to schedule, I copy its block reference and paste that into the [[Agenda]].

    - Date:: [[April 26th, 2021, Monday]]
- When I complete an action labeled #@next, I revisit its home project to label a new task as #@next. If I don’t have time to do that right away, I have a mechanism that helps me make sure projects don’t slip off my radar.

    - Note: Looking forward to seeing what his mechanism is ^rw172174542-note
