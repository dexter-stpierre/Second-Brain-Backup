- Schedule time to connect with your colleagues the way you would around a water cooler. Those connections are the hardest to recreate in a distributed team.

    - Note: I want to do more of this by doing 1:1s with my coworkers so we can get to know each other outside of stand ups. I think doing more of those will be beneficial ^rw176914294-note
