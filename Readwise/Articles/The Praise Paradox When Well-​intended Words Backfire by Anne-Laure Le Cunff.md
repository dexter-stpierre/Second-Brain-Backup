- That’s where the praise paradox comes from. Researchers explain: “Adults are inclined to give children with low self-esteem person praise (e.g., “You’re smart!”) and inflated praise (e.g., “That’s incredibly beautiful!”). Paradoxically, such praise can lower these children’s motivation and feelings of self-worth in the face of setbacks (e.g., when they struggle or fail). Lowered feelings of self-worth, in turn, might invite more person praise and inflated praise from adults, creating a self-sustaining downward spiral.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1419599658/16646796)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/189814785) ^rw189814785
    - Note: Wow. I never thought about how we give different kinds of praise to kids with different levels of self esteem. This is a mistake I want to avoid for sure ^rw189814785-note

- Richard Farson, the co-founder and president of the Western Behavioral Sciences Institute, explains: “Undoubtedly, the most threatening aspect of praise is the obligation it puts on us to be praise-worthy people. If we accept praise, if we really believe the best about ourselves, then we are under an obligation to behave accordingly. (…) The responsibility to be continually at our best, to live up to our talents and abilities, is perhaps our most difficult problem in living.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1419599658/16646815)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/189814786) ^rw189814786
    - Note: I see the pressure of having to live up to expectations in kids all the time. Heck I see it in myself too ^rw189814786-note

- To be effective, praise should be honest, empathetic, and focused on effort rather than abilities. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1419599658/16646822)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/189814787) ^rw189814787
    - Note: Praise that has the largest positive impact celebrates the thing that the person has control over, the work that they put into something ^rw189814787-note

- Instead of fostering a fixed mindset and low self-esteem by making nice comments about the work that has been done, encourage the person to keep on learning by reminding them of their progress curve.
