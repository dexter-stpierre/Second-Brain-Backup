- I'ts time to get pen and paper and start sketching up the ideas you have. My advice is to get a little notebook, it's better to sketch small ideas, if you have a lot of space you won't focus. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/59528284) ^rw59528284

- Let's summarize the process:
  📌 Setting up the environment.
  📌 Identified the project's content and features needed.
  📌 Investigated examples, inspiration and competence.
  📌 Sketched up some designs with pen and paper in a little notebook.
  📌 Digitalized those sketches in a gray scale and with a simple grid.
  📌 Creating a palette.
  📌 Color the digital sketches, make final decorations and fixes. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/59528292) ^rw59528292
