## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- One of the things we consistently emphasized was, “Show. Don’t tell.” Showing is using words that allow a reader to experience a text through their own imagination, while telling is giving a brief summary.

- If a function exists in your program, it has a purpose; otherwise, take it out! If it has a purpose, it has a natural name that describes that purpose. If it has a name, you the code author should include that name in the code, so that the reader does not have to infer that name from reading and mentally executing that function’s code. - Kyle Simpson ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1323106116/13708616)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/177111811) ^rw177111811

- IV. Thou shalt not fret over making names too long. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1323106116/13708622)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/177111812) ^rw177111812

- Variable names need not to be one letter, and in a lot of cases one word is even too short. Descriptive variable names ease the impact when someone sees the code for the first time. When developers write shorter variable names, they tend to write a lot more comments about how the code works. Comments should explain why and your variable names tell us how.
