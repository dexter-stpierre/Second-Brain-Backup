## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- I notice that when I try to mix actually writing code with deciding what code to write, I often forget subtasks or start feeling uncertain and slowing down.

    - Note: This is why I have started trying to create all the sub tasks of things I need to handle under my task in Todoist. That way I know exactly what needs to be done, and can check off the tasks as I complete them ^rw301342249-note

### New highlights synced
- Make a checklist for code review. Eg for every new allocation find where it is freed, for every new error raised find out where it is handled. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fz23j86241mabvd38x6q4kz6)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/303056051) ^rw303056051
