- We know the national costs. In the United States, there is joblessness on a scale not seen since the Great Depression, with more than 33 million unemployed. The Bank of England forecasts the UK economy will fall by 14 percent this year — the steepest decline since 1706. Similar trends can be found across the industrial world. The global economy is veering toward an economic depression not seen for generations. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/60511209) ^rw60511209

- Yet this argument, to many, seems crass. How consequential is an economic loss in balance when lives at risk from COVID-19 are at stake? Understandably, few find such calculations compelling — and tend to side with those who advocate for prolonged lockdowns lasting for months or more. If this were about lives vs money, it would be easy to understand. But look deeper, and this is about lives vs lives — on a scale that has not, so far, been very much discussed. Lockdown will, on a global level, hit the poorest hardest. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/60511210) ^rw60511210

- We have the health impacts in the rich world. To keep hospitals available for the COVID-19 patients who never showed up, patients delayed non-urgent but essential healthcare, including vaccinations, cancer screening, and even chemotherapy. The death toll from this will manifest over the coming years as old infectious diseases find new life and cancer mortality rises. In the UK, cancer deaths have been predicted to rise by about 18,000 due to the disruption in treatment. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/60511211) ^rw60511211
    - Note: When calculating the live lost as a result of the lockdowns it is important to look long term. How many people weren’t able to get critical screening and preventative treatment ^rw60511211-note

- The United Nations forecasts that even if the world economy rebounds in the second half of the year, the economic downturn would increase the numbers in extreme poverty up by anything from 84 million to 132 million. The recession would reverse years of progress in the fight against child mortality in the developing world. The UN’s World Food Program predicts that by the end of the year, the numbers facing acute hunger will double to 265 million. These are staggering figures. If this were to be the result of a natural disaster, it would be worldwide news. Now, it’s just seen as a footnote in the side-effects of lockdown.

    - Note: I don’t see this as a reason to not have lockdowns, I see it as a reason to innovate in how we approach helping people living in poverty around the world ^rw60511212-note

- Take the number of infants and small children dying in developing countries: five million in 2017 (when the last count was taken). A tragic figure, but it would have been 10.6 million had it not been for the improvements made in the past two decades. Progress made each year against diseases and malnutrition means that 300,000 fewer children will die compared with the previous year. When these numbers are compounded, the progress made in a given year saves an additional three million young lives each decade. When that stops, as it now has, the cost can be counted in lives. If lockdown is to cost us two years’ growth, as some have argued, it would end up taking nearly six million young lives in the coming decade.

- Lockdowns, of course, are not all that prevents the global economy from thriving now. People the world over have also changed their behavior out of fear of the virus, with less trade and — therefore — less wealth spread. But mandatory lockdowns worsen the economic downturn. That they are not the only source of economic pain is not a reason to ignore their impact. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/60511214) ^rw60511214
    - Note: I think the assumption that people don’t participate in the economy is because of fear is an unfair assumption. People can make smart choices in response to a pandemic without it being motivated by fear ^rw60511214-note

- Unfortunately, the public debate to date has left little room for our political leaders to consider how our response to the virus impacts lives elsewhere. Each government assesses its success or failure by its own number of coronavirus-related deaths. The scoreboard charts that we see, judging countries on COVID-19 deaths alone, tend not to factor in those killed by the reaction to the virus — at home or abroad.

- We are moral people. We have grown good at thinking about the effects of our decisions on the lives of the world’s poorest, from climate change to trade policy. The shock of a pandemic can narrow the focus, at least at first. But now we’re over the shock, we can perhaps look at the predicted surge in world poverty, and deaths, and consider these as a factor when deciding the future of lockdown. A lot of lives are on the line. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/97596959) ^rw97596959
    - Note: I disagree with the fundamental argument the author is making. If the way in which we are helping people around the world was the only way to do it then I would agree. But I believe we must innovate in our charity. Rather than making people reliant on organizations around the world our goal should be to help these people to become more independent. We should help them learn the skills and put up the infrastructure so that we can move on and help others ^rw97596959-note
