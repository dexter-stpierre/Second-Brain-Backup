## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- I was the absolute master of my old robe. I have become the slave of the new one. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fnswp083cq9z3yctbxgfzs78)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/254694714) ^rw254694714
    - Note: The writer never felt the need to worry about damaging his old robe, since it was well worn. But if he damages the new one he decreases the value and it will no longer be a nice, new robe. In this way he lost the care free freedom of his old robe and is now trapped in service to his new one, ensuring that it stays in a good condition. This brings to mind how people worry about damaging a nice, new car compared to an old one ^rw254694714-note

- My friends, keep your old friends. My friends, fear the touch of wealth. Let my example teach you a lesson. Poverty has its freedoms; opulence has its obstacles.

    - Note: There is something interesting to this statement. The author expected wealth to get rid of his old problems, but discovered that not only did wealth introduce new issues, it also reintroduced some old ones that his poverty eliminated ^rw254694759-note

- My old robe was one with the other rags that surrounded me. A straw chair, a wooden table, a rug from Bergamo, a wood plank that held up a few books, a few smoky prints without frames, hung by its corners on that tapestry. Between these prints three or four suspended plasters formed, along with my old robe, the most harmonious indigence.

    - Note: He found himself in a place where he didn't even appreciate his new robe, it simply accentuated the age and simplicity of everything else he owned ^rw254694857-note

- There was a vacant corner next to my window. This corner asked for a writing desk, which it obtained. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01fnsx9jasbh9gtmbnb9ztqyjn)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/254695092) ^rw254695092
    - Note: Not only did the author have to replace everything he had with nicer things, he also had to fill every available space with nice things ^rw254695092-note
