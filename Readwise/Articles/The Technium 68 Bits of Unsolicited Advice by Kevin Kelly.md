## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- Always demand a deadline. A deadline weeds out the extraneous and the ordinary. It prevents you from trying to make it perfect, so you have to make it different. Different is better. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/96542954) ^rw96542954
    - Note: Deadlines can be massively beneficial for me. Having a deadline ensures that expectations are explicit. It keeps me from spending too much time perfecting something and ensures that I work towards a working product rather than a perfect product. ^rw96542954-note

- Being able to listen well is a superpower. While listening to someone you love keep asking them “Is there more?”, until there is no more. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/96542955) ^rw96542955
    - Note: Being able to listen is an extremely valuable skill. Always ask people that you love if they have more to say on something until there is nothing more to say ^rw96542955-note

- Treating a person to a meal never fails, and is so easy to do. It’s powerful with old friends and a great way to make new friends. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/96542956) ^rw96542956
    - Note: There is no better way to spend time with someone than eating food together. It is a great way to reconnect with old friends and an excellent way to make new ones ^rw96542956-note
    - Date:: [[October 8th, 2020, Thursday]]
- Extraordinary claims should require extraordinary evidence to be believed. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/96542957) ^rw96542957
    - Note: Don’t take someone’s word at face value. If someone makes a claim that seems unbelievable that is probably because it is. If they don’t provide sufficient evidence than don’t trust it ^rw96542957-note

- Don’t be the smartest person in the room. Hangout with, and learn from, people smarter than yourself. Even better, find smart people who will disagree with you. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/96542958) ^rw96542958
    - Note: Always make sure to spend time with people who know more than me and that I can learn from. Even better if we don’t see eye to eye in all areas ^rw96542958-note

- • The purpose of a habit is to remove that action from self-negotiation. You no longer expend energy deciding whether to do it. You just do it. Good habits can range from telling the truth, to flossing. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/96542959) ^rw96542959
    - Note: Something is a habit when it isn’t something that I have to convince myself to do. I no longer waste my energy deciding whether to do it, I just do it. I should put the effort in to make the most important things in my life a habit ^rw96542959-note

- To make something good, just do it. To make something great, just re-do it, re-do it, re-do it. The secret to making fine things is in remaking them. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/96542960) ^rw96542960

- If you are looking for something in your house, and you finally find it, when you’re done with it, don’t put it back where you found it. Put it back where you first looked for it. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/96542962) ^rw96542962

- Separate the processes of creation from improving. You can’t write and edit, or sculpt and polish, or make and analyze at the same time. If you do, the editor stops the creator. While you invent, don’t select. While you sketch, don’t inspect. While you write the first draft, don’t reflect. At the start, the creator mind must be unleashed from judgement. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/96542963) ^rw96542963
    - Note: I need to learn to allow myself to create without fear of judgement. My editor side can prevent my creator side from expressing itself freely, an important pillar of creativity. I can always come back to correct and edit, but I can’t have another chance of working in that original flow again ^rw96542963-note

- When an object is lost, 95% of the time it is hiding within arm’s reach of where it was last seen. Search in all possible locations in that radius and you’ll find it. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/96542964) ^rw96542964

- You are what you do. Not what you say, not what you believe, not how you vote, but what you spend your time on. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/96542965) ^rw96542965
    - Note: What I spend my time doing is a far clearer indicator of who I am than anything else. If I believe something, value something, or aspire to something the strength of that will show in how I live my life. ^rw96542965-note

- Before you are old, attend as many funerals as you can bear, and listen. Nobody talks about the departed’s achievements. The only thing people will remember is what kind of person you were while you were achieving. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/96542966) ^rw96542966

- If you desperately need a job, you are just another problem for a boss; if you can solve many of the problems the boss has right now, you are hired. To be hired, think like your boss. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/96542967) ^rw96542967

- Rule of 7 in research. You can find out anything if you are willing to go seven levels. If the first source you ask doesn’t know, ask them who you should ask next, and so on down the line. If you are willing to go to the 7th source, you’ll almost always get your answer. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/96542968) ^rw96542968
    - Note: When seeking answers on something never give up on the first source. If it is an answer worth finding it is worth spending substantial time seeking it. Use the source’s of your sources until you reach the 7th level. In each deeper level there are details that the author didn’t use that might contain your answers ^rw96542968-note

- Buying tools: Start by buying the absolute cheapest tools you can find. Upgrade the ones you use a lot. If you wind up using some tool for a job, buy the very best you can afford. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/96542969) ^rw96542969
    - Note: Don’t waste your money on the very best tools. Buy cheap, notice the ones that you use the most, and upgrade those ones. You will save more money starting with a cheap tool and upgrading it than if you buy all of the best tools ^rw96542969-note

- Over the long term, the future is decided by optimists. To be an optimist you don’t have to ignore all the many problems we create; you just have to imagine improving our capacity to solve problems. [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/96542970) ^rw96542970
    - Note: Being an optimist doesn’t mean ignoring the problems in my life, it means knowing that I can come up with creative solutions ^rw96542970-note
