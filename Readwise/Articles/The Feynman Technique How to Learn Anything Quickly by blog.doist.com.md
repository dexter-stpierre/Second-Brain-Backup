## Highlights
### New highlights synced
- You have to start small. You really only have a page (or a few) to fill up with information. You can’t fit everything there is to know about “Evolutionary Science” or “Microeconomics” or “Psychology” on a page. Instead work on smaller more defined concepts ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1439876063/17306530)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/219736040) ^rw219736040

- A classic learning mistake is reading an article or textbook and considering our learning complete. In reality, reading is not understanding. We might even take notes, essentially transcribing a resource’s sentences into our notebooks.

- true understanding requires a more active process like teaching. Start out by formally teaching yourself. Write out a summary in your own words without looking at your notes. Or explain it to yourself out loud. Then take it to the next level by teaching other people.

    - Note: Teaching someone is the best way to solidify that you know something. And doing it early will solidify more information quicker. That’s why David Parell and others recommend to start writing about something as soon as you start learning about it. You don’t have to publish everything immediately, but your smaller writing can someday become part of a larger one ^rw219872230-note

- Learning should be iterative. More often than not, learning something challenging takes several attempts. With the Feynman Technique, returning to the source material is an explicit part of the learning process. When gaps in our knowledge arise and our explanations aren’t quite right, revisiting our primary and secondary sources can help solidify what we’re learning.

    - Note: When it becomes clear that you have a gap in your learning return to the sources you learned from, or find new ones focused on your gap. Remember, you are learning something you don’t know, when there are holes in your learning it simply shows another, more specific thing to learn about ^rw220027388-note

- When we’re actively part of creating our own summaries and reasoning, drawing intentionally from original information to fill our blind spots, we can more readily commit knowledge to our long-term memory.

- Every field of study has its own specialized terms. While it may be important to know them, it’s also important to not confuse knowing jargon with knowing concepts.

    - Note: Learning isn’t about memorizing a bunch of words. It’s about exploring how concepts mesh together and impact each other ^rw220027390-note
