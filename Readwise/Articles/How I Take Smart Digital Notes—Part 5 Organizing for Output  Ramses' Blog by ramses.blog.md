- I’ll dive deep into how to tune your filter in future posts, but my primary tool is called twelve favorite problems—an idea I got from Richard Feynman (via Tiago Forte):
  “You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say, “How did he do it? He must be a genius!” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411182365/16364183)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178290197) ^rw178290197

- Elaboration is a critical component of learning. When we read and take short notes, we may have the illusion of knowing. Only when we dig deep and try to explain complex ideas do we discover if we genuinely grok a concept.

    - Note: Taking the concepts that you have learned and connecting them to other ideas and creating something new out of them is when you really show what you have learned ^rw178781490-note

- An excellent tool for elaboration is what Andy Matuschak calls evergreen notes; short, atomic descriptions of concepts, and thoughts on how to apply them. They’re never written in one go; like mini-articles, they undergo many revisions before they can be called evergreen notes.

    - Note: I want to start writting evergeen notes. They take a lot of time and revision but they seem like a great way to build a knowledge base. ^rw178781491-note

- Document your work, make sense of what you learn, and teach others. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1411182365/16373176)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/178781492) ^rw178781492

- The critical point to stress is that I have a system to keep the intermediate products of my thinking. By having my previous thoughts in front of me, and my 12 problems clear, I can slowly chip away to a solution.

- Once I have collected information from my note-taking system, I start to give structure to the piece. This step brings more clarity to my thinking, and often more nuance. While outlining, I sometimes discover I don’t know enough about the topic yet, and that I need to do additional research.

    - Note: Structure bring clarity to a piece of writing and reveals areas that might require additional research to write with a nuanced view ^rw178846521-note
