- Nothing I say here is intended to dictate how anyone else should vote, but rather to point to a perspective that seems to be neglected. Yes, this perspective sways my vote. But you need not be sinning if you weigh matters differently. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1354304826/14365709)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/103189513) ^rw103189513
    - Note: I appreciate how he isn’t saying that people are sinning if they prioritize differently than him, he is simply sharing the perspective that has made a difference in how he will vote, in the effort to help others see things in a way that they haven’t ^rw103189513-note

- Actually, this is a long-overdue article attempting to explain why I remain baffled that so many Christians consider the sins of unrepentant sexual immorality (porneia), unrepentant boastfulness (alazoneia), unrepentant vulgarity (aischrologia), unrepentant factiousness (dichostasiai), and the like, to be only toxic for our nation, while policies that endorse baby-killing, sex-switching, freedom-limiting, and socialistic overreach are viewed as deadly.

    - Note: He doesn’t say that one is better or worse here, he is simply pointing out how others say some are worse then others. I think the significant part here is the “unrepentant” disclaimer in the first set ^rw103189514-note

- The reason I put those Greek words in parentheses is to give a graphic reminder that these are sins mentioned in the New Testament. To be more specific, they are sins that destroy people. They are not just deadly. They are deadly forever. They lead to eternal destruction (2 Thessalonians 1:9).

    - Note: The first set of the fore mentioned issues are specifically mentioned in the Bible as son, deadly sins ^rw103189515-note

- Forgiveness through Christ is always possible where there is repentance and childlike trust in Jesus. But where humble repentance is absent, the sins condemn. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1354304826/14365743)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/103189516) ^rw103189516
    - Note: Trump has specifically said that he doesn’t pray for forgiveness ^rw103189516-note

- There is a character connection between rulers and subjects. When the Bible describes a king by saying, “He sinned and made Israel to sin” (1 Kings 14:16), it does not mean he twisted their arm. It means his influence shaped the people. That’s the calling of a leader. Take the lead in giving shape to the character of your people. So it happens. For good or for ill.

- Therefore, Christians communicate a falsehood to unbelievers (who are also baffled!) when we act as if policies and laws that protect life and freedom are more precious than being a certain kind of person. The church is paying dearly, and will continue to pay, for our communicating this falsehood year after year.

- I think Roe is an evil decision. I think Planned Parenthood is a code name for baby-killing and (historically at least) ethnic cleansing. And I think it is baffling and presumptuous to assume that pro-abortion policies kill more people than a culture-saturating, pro-self pride.

- It is naive to think that a man can be effectively pro-life and manifest consistently the character traits that lead to death — temporal and eternal. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1354304826/14365801)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/103189520) ^rw103189520

- May I suggest to pastors that in the quietness of your study you do this? Imagine that America collapses. First anarchy, then tyranny — from the right or the left. Imagine that religious freedom is gone. What remains for Christians is fines, prison, exile, and martyrdom. Then ask yourself this: Has my preaching been developing real, radical Christians? Christians who can sing on the scaffold ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1354304826/14365804)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/103189521) ^rw103189521

- Or have you neglected these greatest of all realities and repeatedly diverted their attention onto the strategies of politics? Have you inadvertently created the mindset that the greatest issue in life is saving America and its earthly benefits? Or have you shown your people that the greatest issue is exalting Christ with or without America? Have you shown them that the people who do the most good for the greatest number for the longest time (including America!) are people who have the aroma of another world with another King?

- When I consider the remote possibility that I might do any good by endorsing the devastation already evident in the two choices before me, I am loath to undermine my calling (and the church’s mission) to stand for Christ-exalting faith and hope and love.

- With a cheerful smile, I will explain to my unbelieving neighbor why my allegiance to Jesus set me at odds with death — death by abortion and death by arrogance. I will take him to Psalm 139 and Romans 1. And if he is willing, I will show him how abortion and arrogance can be forgiven because of Christ (Ephesians 1:7). And I will invite him to become an exile — to have a kingdom that will never be shaken, not even when America is a footnote in the archives of the new creation.
