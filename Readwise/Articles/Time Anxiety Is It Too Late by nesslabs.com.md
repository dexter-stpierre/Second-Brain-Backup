## Highlights

- While death anxiety is the fear of running out of time, time anxiety is the fear of wasting your time. It’s an obsession about spending your time in the most meaningful way possible. And when society tells us—or when we interpret signs from society as saying—that it’s too late to achieve a particular goal, we don’t perceive it as meaningful enough. We need—we demand—that what we do with our lives actually matters.

    - Note: Time anxiety is an obsession with productivity that doesn’t allow you to do anything new because you are starting at “square one”. If you have to restart at the beginning then you aren’t using all the progress you have already made. But this doesn’t actually help us stay productive, it prevents us from pursuing our goals that don’t fit into a little box ^rw110571792-note

- “Am I creating the greatest amount of value with my life that I can? Will I feel, when it comes my time to die, that I spent too much of my time frivolously?” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1355518203/14599233)) [Open in Readwise](https://readwise.io/open/110571793) ^rw110571793
    - Note: I don’t know that I care that much about how I spend “too much of my time”, I more care that my life overall creates value rather than destroying it ^rw110571793-note

- But, paradoxically, this over-optimisation may prevent us from creating the most value with our lives. We limit ourselves by always calculating the best potential outcome through our personal perception of possible. Beating time anxiety means shifting our focus from outcomes to output so we can spend our energy on things we can actually control.

    - Note: When we are so focused on creating outcomes we miss the thing that truly creates the most value, the people around us ^rw110571794-note

- “And if we continue asking why, like the child we once were, trying to excavate down to our most rudimentary ambition—a time-worn exercise—we’ll eventually find all reasons lead to the same place, to the one core reason for living we’d sought all along, the core reason against which we measure the value of everything we do: to be happy.”

- Define what “time well spent” means to you: sit down, and think about what really makes you happy and gets you in the flow, without overthinking about how feasible the final outcome would be. Just think of your output and how it makes you feel to work on producing it. For example, don’t think about happy it would make you to publish a book. Ask yourself if you really enjoy writing. Don’t think about how proud you would be to run a marathon. Question whether you like running. Create a short list of activities you really enjoy and that bring value to yourself or to the world.

    - Note: Deciding whether or not to do something based on the process rather than the outcome helps to ensure that you aren’t torturing yourself by doing something that sounds good, but you really don’t want to do ^rw110571796-note

- Cut out time-consuming distractions: the moments we spend mindlessly scrolling on social media or watching random videos do contribute to time anxiety. Do a quick audit of your content consumption patterns and try to cut out the amount of time you spend in an input rather than output mode.
