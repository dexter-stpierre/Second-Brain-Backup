# Weekly Reviews

## [[Imported From Roam]]

- This will simply be taking about 1-2 hours to go over my [[ðŸ“… Daily Pages]] and take notes on how the week went
- This will include things like how I did on progress towards my [[[[Goals]] for 2020]], how productive I was, highlights and lowlights of the week, and possibly [[Weekly Questions]]
- I should continue to brainstorm how to better do this system.
- Maybe there on online [[Resource]]s?

- Maybe this could also include a [[Weekly Plan]] for the next week?
	- Yes, this should for sure be part of the process
- Three steps to a [[Weekly Review]]:
	1. Get clear
		- Get everything from the past week out of your mind and into your system
	2. Get current
		- Plan the week ahead. Todos, meetings, goals.
		- Make sure mine and Taylor's calendars align and we aren't missing anything
	3. Get Creative
		- What projects have I been postponing can I fit into my schedule?
		- Brainstorming new future projects
		- This is a chance to be truly creative in how I approach my life
- Don't wait to have a whole system figured out, start with something and see where it takes you
	- Create a system as you go along, take notes on what goes well and what doesn't go well
- This is not working time, it's reviewing time
- If a task takes more than 2 minutes to do don't do it now - schedule it!
- How did I progress on my goals this week & how can I do so next week
- What is the purpose of me doing this?
	- I get to consolidate the lessons learned in that week all in one spot - I no longer need to search for them.
	- Reviewing lessons learned helps to reinforce them
	- Gives a chance to reflecting on situations that I didn't take the time for during the week
	- Going into the next week with an overall plan will lead to a more productive week.
	- Reviewing on a consistent schedule makes the less frequent (monthly & yearly) reviews a lot easier.
	- Ideas that I have throughout the week aren't being recorded and forgotten, they are recorded and reviewed and can it can lead to the ideas being better fostered and grown
	- Creates intentional space to focus on myself & my growth
- Should there also be [[Weekly Pages]] where I can plan out the whole week?
	- What does this look like?
	- A page that is titled with a date range, covering the first and last day of the week.
	- Each day should have a heading where I can organize a plan under.
